A source at SeaWorld said that after seizing her, the whale dove deep underwater. Trainers eventually had to wrangle the animal into a smaller pool before they could retrieve her body about 40 minutes later. \n\nWESH: Watch tourist's video just before attack \n\nA former head of animal training said Friday that Brancheau left herself vulnerable to attack and that she may have broken the park's training protocol. \n\n\"Dawn, if she was standing here right now, would tell you that that was her mistake in allowing that to happen,\" said former SeaWorld trainer Thad Lacinak, who had worked with Brancheau in the past, on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" \n\nLacinak called Brancheau \"one the best killer whale trainers I ever worked with.\" \n\nStill, he said, Brancheau should not have been lying in a slideout -- a platform covered by roughly 4 inches of water -- so close to a killer whale.

Diagnosed with diabetes , Thomas would need to inject himself with insulin three times a day for the rest of his life or risk nerve damage, blindness, and even death. And if that weren't bad enough, he had no health insurance. After a month of feeling upset, Thomas decided he'd better find a way to fight back. He left Canton, Michigan for New York, got a job waiting tables, nicknamed himself the Diabetic Rockstar , and created diabeticrockstar.com, a free online community for diabetics and their loved ones--a place where over 1,100 people share personal stories, information, and resources. \n\nJason Swencki\"s son, Kody, was diagnosed with type diabetes at six. Father and son visit the online children's forums together most evenings. \"Kody gets so excited, writing to kids from all over,\" says Swencki, one of the site's volunteers. \"They know what he's going through, so he doesn't feel alone.\" Kody is anything but alone: Diabetes is now the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, with 24 million diagnosed cases. And more people are being diagnosed at younger ages. \n\nThese days, Thomas's main focus is his charity, Fight It, which provides medicines and supplies to people--225 to date--who can't afford a diabetic's huge expenses. Fight-it.org has raised about $23,000--in products and in cash. In May, Thomas will hold the first annual Diabetic Rockstar Festival in the Caribbean. \n\nEven with a staff of 22 volunteers, Thomas often devotes up to 50 hours a week to his cause, while still doing his full-time job waiting tables. \"Of the diabetes charities out there, most are putting money into finding a cure,\" says Bentley Gubar one of Rockstar's original members. \"But Christopher is the only person I know saying people need help now.\"","questions":[{"input_text":"What was Christopher's day job?","turn_id":1},{"input_text":"What disease was he diagnosed with?","turn_id":2},{"input_text":"How often did he have to inject himself with insulin?","turn_id":3},{"input_text":"How old was Kody when he was diagnosed with diabetes?","turn_id":4},{"input_text":"How many diagnosed cases of diabetes are there?","turn_id":5},{"input_text":"What website did Christopher start?","turn_id":6},{"input_text":"How many people use the site?","turn_id":7},{"input_text":"What is the name of his charity?","turn_id":8},{"input_text":"How many people has the charity helped?","turn_id":9},{"input_text":"How much money has the charity raised?","turn_id":10}],"answers":[{"span_start":0,"span_end":66,"span_text":"Christopher Thomas, 27, was a writer by night and a teacher by day","input_text":"teaching","turn_id":1},{"span_start":72,"span_end":154,"span_text":"he noticed he was always tired and was losing weight fast.

following note: \n\n\"DEAR FELIX: \n\n\"When you go down to see old Tod, why not put up with us at Becket? Any time will suit, and the car can take you over to Joyfields when you like. Give the pen a rest. Clara joins in hoping you'll come, and Mother is still here. No use, I suppose, to ask Flora. \n\n\"Yours ever, \n\n\"STANLEY.\" \n\nDuring the twenty years of his brother's sojourn there Felix had been down to Becket perhaps once a year, and latterly alone; for Flora, having accompanied him the first few times, had taken a firm stand. \n\n\"My dear,\" she said, \"I feel all body there.\" \n\nFelix had rejoined: \n\n\"No bad thing, once in a way.\" \n\nBut Flora had remained firm. Life was too short! She did not get on well with Clara. Neither did Felix feel too happy in his sister-in-law's presence; but the gray top-hat instinct had kept him going there, for one ought to keep in touch with one's brothers. \n\nHe replied to Stanley: \n\n\"DEAR STANLEY: \n\n\"Delighted; if I may bring my two youngsters. We'll arrive to-morrow at four-fifty. \n\n\"Yours affectionately, \n\n\"FELIX.\" \n\nTravelling with Nedda was always jolly; one could watch her eyes noting, inquiring, and when occasion served, have one's little finger hooked in and squeezed. Travelling with Alan was convenient, the young man having a way with railways which Felix himself had long despaired of acquiring. Neither of the children had ever been at Becket, and though Alan was seldom curious, and Nedda too curious about everything to be specially so about this, yet Felix experienced in their company the sensations of a new adventure.
