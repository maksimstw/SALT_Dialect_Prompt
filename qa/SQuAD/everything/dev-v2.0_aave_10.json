The rotors got a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam act upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consist of a similar, but fixed, series of blades serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhaust into a surface condenser provide a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"What nuclear power plants heat to create electricity?","id":"571166352419e314009555f1","answers":[{"text":"water","answer_start":67},{"text":"water","answer_start":67},{"text":"water","answer_start":67}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the steam generated by a nuclear power plant drive?","id":"571166352419e314009555f2","answers":[{"text":"turbine","answer_start":98},{"text":"turbine","answer_start":98},{"text":"a turbine connected to an electrical generator","answer_start":96}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In a nuclear power plant, what the steam turbine connected to?","id":"571166352419e314009555f3","answers":[{"text":"electrical generator","answer_start":122},{"text":"electrical generator","answer_start":122},{"text":"a turbo generator set with propulsion provided by electric motors","answer_start":347}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is it called when steam propel a turbo generator with electric motor propulsion?","id":"571166352419e314009555f4","answers":[{"text":"turbo-electric transmission","answer_start":296},{"text":"turbo-electric transmission,","answer_start":296},{"text":"turbo-electric transmission","answer_start":296}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where was non-condensing direct-drive locomotives notably used for fast passenger trains?","id":"571166352419e314009555f5","answers":[{"text":"Britain","answer_start":632},{"text":"Britain","answer_start":632},{"text":"Britain","answer_start":632}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"water","answer_start":67}],"question":"What do nuclear power plants heat to create steam turbines?","id":"5ad3fabc604f3c001a3ffb1b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"turbine","answer_start":206}],"question":"What does the steam generated by a auxiliary power drive?","id":"5ad3fabc604f3c001a3ffb1c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"electrical generator","answer_start":128}],"question":"What in a nuclear power plant is the diesel turbine connected to?","id":"5ad3fabc604f3c001a3ffb1d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"turbo-electric transmission","answer_start":302}],"question":"What is it called when steam propels a turbo generator with diesel motor propulsion?","id":"5ad3fabc604f3c001a3ffb1e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Britain","answer_start":644}],"question":"Where were non-condensing direct-drive locomotives notably used for fast passenger ships?","id":"5ad3fabc604f3c001a3ffb1f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Virtually all nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating water to provide steam drive a turbine connected to an electrical generator.

This done meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts done had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice view is that if EU law conflict with a provision of national law, then EU law got primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could done brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if dey would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, done restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would \"ain't overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU. But despite no views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states done not accepted the same analysis."},{"qas":[{"question":"What all member states agree take precedence over national law?","id":"572699db5951b619008f7799","answers":[{"text":"EU law","answer_start":59},{"text":"EU law","answer_start":59},{"text":"EU law","answer_start":59},{"text":"EU law","answer_start":59}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What issues member states say the Court of Justice do not have the final say on?","id":"572699db5951b619008f779a","answers":[{"text":"foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights","answer_start":198},{"text":"foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights","answer_start":198},{"text":"foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights","answer_start":198},{"text":"on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights","answer_start":195}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was the European Communities Act created?","id":"572699db5951b619008f779b","answers":[{"text":"1972","answer_start":739},{"text":"1972","answer_start":739},{"text":"1972","answer_start":739},{"text":"1972","answer_start":739}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In what cases can the EU not override German law?","id":"572699db5951b619008f779c","answers":[{"text":"if the EU do not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles","answer_start":1394},{"text":"if the EU do not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles","answer_start":1394},{"text":"if the EU do not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles","answer_start":1394}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the EU legitimacy rest on?","id":"572699db5951b619008f779d","answers":[{"text":"the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.","answer_start":1951},{"text":"the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people","answer_start":1951},{"text":"the ultimate authority of member states","answer_start":1951},{"text":"the ultimate authority of member states","answer_start":1951}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights","answer_start":178}],"question":"What does the EU accept about the Court Justice?","id":"5ad13dbb645df0001a2d1368","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law","answer_start":338}],"question":"What is the basic principle of the Canadian Parliament?","id":"5ad13dbb645df0001a2d1369","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1972","answer_start":742}],"question":"When was the European Communities Act denied acceptance?","id":"5ad13dbb645df0001a2d136a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law","answer_start":1502}],"question":"What was not the view of the German Constitutional Court from Solange I and Solange II?","id":"5ad13dbb645df0001a2d136b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.","answer_start":1966}],"question":"What does the EU's legitimacy not rest on?","id":"5ad13dbb645df0001a2d136c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Generally speaking, while all member states recognise that EU law take primacy over national law where this agreed in the Treaties, they do not accept that the Court of Justice got the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights. In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wish to expressly legislate against EU law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary\" and so \"it have always been clear\" that UK courts got a duty \"to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.\" More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, dey could be \"fundamental principles\" of common law, and Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation\" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU do not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law.

In part this reflect that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive require that every worker at least 4 weeks done paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law. However, on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens standing to make claims based on national laws implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves. Directives do not done so called \"horizontal\" direct effect (i.e. between non-state parties).

A member state could \"not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entail.\" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it done not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm no systems, on no basis that it done not been notified to the Commission as no Directive required. Third, if a Directive give expression to a \"general principle\" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follow from K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code \u00a7622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before no dismissal.

She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

The Court of Justice quickly acknowledged that the duty of interpretation cannot contradict plain words in a national statute. But, fifth, if a member state done failed to implement a Directive, a citizen may ain't able to bring claims against other non-state parties, but can sue the member state itself for failure to implement the law. So, in Francovich v Italy, the Italian government done failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers done gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss.

Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. This was the first time competition law principles was included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules was included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market ain't distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies was established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid.

According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them got a less productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages was considerably mixed, and it remain unclear whether the \"endgame\" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but gon burden people lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so-called \"four freedoms\" was thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e.g. different Value Added Tax rates). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade ain't supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice done taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people well being."},{"qas":[{"question":"What help the process of free movement of goods?","id":"5726b718dd62a815002e8dbe","answers":[{"text":"a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination","answer_start":64},{"text":"a customs union","answer_start":64},{"text":"a customs union","answer_start":64}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What article 34 discriminate against in Procureur du Roi v Dassonville?","id":"5726b718dd62a815002e8dbf","answers":[{"text":"parallel importers like Mr Dassonville","answer_start":833},{"text":"parallel importers","answer_start":833},{"text":"parallel importers","answer_start":833}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Article 34 meant states could be responsible for what?","id":"5726b718dd62a815002e8dc0","answers":[{"text":"private actors","answer_start":1214},{"text":"private actors","answer_start":1214},{"text":"private actors","answer_start":1214}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which case was French vigilantes sabotaging shipments of Spanish Strawberries?","id":"5726b718dd62a815002e8dc1","answers":[{"text":"Commission v France","answer_start":1247},{"text":"Commission v France French","answer_start":1247},{"text":"Commission v France French","answer_start":1247}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In Schmidberger v Austria, the Court of Justice came to the conclusion that Austria ain't infringe upon no article 34 by failing to ban a what?","id":"5726b718dd62a815002e8dc2","answers":[{"text":"a protest blocked heavy traffic","answer_start":2349},{"text":"a protest","answer_start":2349},{"text":"a protest","answer_start":2349}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination","answer_start":64}],"question":"What does not help the free movement of goods?","id":"5ad15289645df0001a2d175a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"duties","answer_start":169}],"question":"What is not prohibited between member states?","id":"5ad15289645df0001a2d175b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"imports","answer_start":137}],"question":"What the the EU not manage from non-member states?","id":"5ad15289645df0001a2d175c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"private actors","answer_start":1229}],"question":"What were states not responsible for in Article 34?","id":"5ad15289645df0001a2d175d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Commission v France","answer_start":1262}],"question":"What case were French vigilantes helping shipments of Spanish Strawberries?","id":"5ad15289645df0001a2d175e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manage imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, could not get no certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, apply equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company had government appointees. It also mean states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes was continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state got laws or practices directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it done been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe no article 34 by failing to ban a protest blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger German undertaking, was prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018fundamental pillars of a democratic society\u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it take gotta be applied proportionately. This mean the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36."},{"qas":[{"question":"What the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law require all spirits and liqueur to have?","id":"5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e8","answers":[{"text":"25","answer_start":708},{"text":"25 per cent","answer_start":708},{"text":"25 per cent","answer_start":708}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which country Rewe-Zentrale AG wish to import from?","id":"5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e9","answers":[{"text":"France","answer_start":918},{"text":"France","answer_start":918},{"text":"France","answer_start":918}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which year was the case Commission v Italy dealt with cocoa products?","id":"5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ea","answers":[{"text":"2003","answer_start":1775},{"text":"2003","answer_start":1775},{"text":"2003","answer_start":1775}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?","id":"5726b929f1498d1400e8e8eb","answers":[{"text":"cocoa butter","answer_start":1990},{"text":"cocoa butter","answer_start":1990},{"text":"cocoa butter","answer_start":1990}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?","id":"5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ec","answers":[{"text":"motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers","answer_start":2551},{"text":"motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers","answer_start":2551},{"text":"motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers","answer_start":2551}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"25 per cent","answer_start":710}],"question":"What was maximum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?","id":"5ad153e9645df0001a2d1796","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"France","answer_start":921}],"question":"Which country dod Rewe-Zentrale AG not wish to import from?","id":"5ad153e9645df0001a2d1797","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Court of Justice","answer_start":965}],"question":"Who accepted the German government's arguments that the measure proportional protected public health?","id":"5ad153e9645df0001a2d1798","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label","answer_start":2203}],"question":"What did the Court of Justice justify about a low content of vegetable fat?","id":"5ad153e9645df0001a2d1799","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measure the Court of Justice done developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories ain't closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs was over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages was available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily apply to requirements about a product content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"no chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify \"chocolate substitute\" no label. This was derogatory in the consumers eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make no trailers. This ain't product no requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affect the access of that product to the market\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which two importers claimed that under a French competition law, they was prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?","id":"5726ba2c708984140094cf59","answers":[{"text":"Keck and Mithouard","answer_start":289},{"text":"Keck and Mithouard","answer_start":289},{"text":"Keck and Mithouard","answer_start":289}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The aim of the French competition law was to do what?","id":"5726ba2c708984140094cf5a","answers":[{"text":"cut throat competition","answer_start":496},{"text":"prevent cut throat competition","answer_start":488},{"text":"prevent cut throat competition","answer_start":488}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which case the Court of Justice review Swedish bans on advertising to young children under 12?","id":"5726ba2c708984140094cf5b","answers":[{"text":"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini","answer_start":978},{"text":"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini","answer_start":978},{"text":"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini","answer_start":978}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Under which Directive the EU harmonize restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising?","id":"5726ba2c708984140094cf5c","answers":[{"text":"the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive","answer_start":1852},{"text":"the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive","answer_start":1852},{"text":"the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive","answer_start":1852}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Keck and Mithouard","answer_start":291}],"question":"Which two importers did not claim that under French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?","id":"5ad1556e645df0001a2d17da","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"selling arrangements","answer_start":128}],"question":"What did the Court of Justice rule fell under TFEU article 34?","id":"5ad1556e645df0001a2d17db","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade","answer_start":487}],"question":"What was not the aim of the TFEU article 34 law?","id":"5ad1556e645df0001a2d17dc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini","answer_start":990}],"question":"Which case did the Court of Justice not review Swedish bans on advertising to young children und er 12?","id":"5ad1556e645df0001a2d17dd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In contrast to product requirements or other laws hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that \"selling arrangements\" would be presumed to not fall into TFEU no article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder no trade. The Court of Justice held, as \"in law and in fact\" it was an equally applicable \"selling arrangement\" (not something alter a product content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not gotta be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \"in fact\" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but dey is restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans done remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising was \"the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate\" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers \"traditional social practices and to local habits and customs\" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \"factor of production\". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This mean the basic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" anybody economically active, which include everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in no money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as dey was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. \"worker\" status mean protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), got rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement done become politically contentious as nationalist political parties done manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically \"all available research find little impact\" of \"labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers\"."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which articles of the Free Movement of Workers Regulation set out the primary provisions on equal treatment of workers?","id":"5726bc1add62a815002e8ea6","answers":[{"text":"article 1 to 7","answer_start":40},{"text":"article 1 to 7","answer_start":40},{"text":"article 1 to 7","answer_start":40}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which Belgian footballer claimed that he should be allowed to transfer from one football club to another when his contract was fulfilled?","id":"5726bc1add62a815002e8ea7","answers":[{"text":"Jean-Marc Bosman","answer_start":376},{"text":"the Belgian Football Association v Bosman","answer_start":306},{"text":"Jean-Marc Bosman","answer_start":376}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What language the Court of Justice accept to be required to teach in a Dublin college in Groner v Minister for Education?","id":"5726bc1add62a815002e8ea8","answers":[{"text":"Gaelic","answer_start":866},{"text":"Gaelic","answer_start":866},{"text":"Gaelic","answer_start":866}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which case was a Dutch national not entitled to continue receiving benefits when he moved to Belgium?","id":"5726bc1add62a815002e8ea9","answers":[{"text":"Hendrix v Employee","answer_start":2516},{"text":"Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute","answer_start":2516},{"text":"Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute","answer_start":2516}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In the case Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, how many hours was the Dutch woman in question working in Germany?","id":"5726bc1add62a815002e8eaa","answers":[{"text":"between 3 and 14 hours a week","answer_start":2913},{"text":"3 and 14 hours a week","answer_start":2921},{"text":"between 3 and 14 hours a week","answer_start":2913}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7","answer_start":0}],"question":"What did not set out the main provision on equal treatment of workers?","id":"5ad157cf645df0001a2d1814","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state","answer_start":169}],"question":"What did articles 1 to 4 not generally require of workers?","id":"5ad157cf645df0001a2d1815","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Jean-Marc Bosman","answer_start":374}],"question":"Which Belgian footballer claimed that he should not be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Liege to USL Dunkerque?","id":"5ad157cf645df0001a2d1816","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"equal treatment","answer_start":2411}],"question":"What did most people not require regarding social advantages?","id":"5ad157cf645df0001a2d1817","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service","answer_start":3197}],"question":"What is the general justificatin for not limiting free movement in TFEUrticles 45(3)?","id":"5ad157cf645df0001a2d1818","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The Free Movement of Workers Regulation article 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer no discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rule constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and was unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure ain't disproportionate. By no contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) require equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man wrought in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court done approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have no right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man  done wrought full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could.

This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, done set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they was non-discriminatory, \"justified by imperative requirements in the general interest\" and proportionately applied. All people or entities engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or \"undertakings\" such as companies or firms, got a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice done held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 got both \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\" direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 say states are exempt from infringing others freedom of establishment when they exercise \"official authority\", but this did an advocate work (as opposed to a court  ain't official.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice done held that secondary education fall outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state fund it, though higher education do not. Health care generally count as a service. In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within no article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \"service\" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \"international medical science\" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court require that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this also true in the context of the UK National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs was controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \"undesirable developments in securities trading\" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \"laserdrome\" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents done protested against \"playing at killing\" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm done sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people views was highly divergent.

This meant the Daily Mail newspaper parent company could not evade no tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not gotta justify its action, as rules on company seats was not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a31 of capital to start a company, while Denmark legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around \u20ac27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and dey was less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attract most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company no right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wish to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draw a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it ain't entirely clear why."}]},"10":{"title":"Amazon_rainforest","paragraphs":[]},"11":{"title":"Ctenophora","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What unique about  a hermaphrodite?","id":"5725c57a89a1e219009abe5e","answers":[{"text":"can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg","answer_start":48},{"text":"it can fertilize its own egg","answer_start":89},{"text":"a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm","answer_start":32}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What can a simultaneous hermaphrodite do?","id":"5725c57a89a1e219009abe5f","answers":[{"text":"can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time","answer_start":180},{"text":"produce both eggs and sperm at the same time","answer_start":184},{"text":"produce both eggs and sperm at the same time","answer_start":184}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of hermaphrodite produce egg and sperm at different times?","id":"5725c57a89a1e219009abe60","answers":[{"text":"sequential","answer_start":237},{"text":"sequential hermaphrodites","answer_start":237},{"text":"simultaneous","answer_start":145}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which species eggs are fertilized and kept inside the parents body until hatched?","id":"5725c57a89a1e219009abe61","answers":[{"text":"platyctenids","answer_start":362},{"text":"platyctenids","answer_start":362},{"text":"platyctenids","answer_start":362}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What cause the population of ctenophora to grow at an explosive rate?","id":"5725c57a89a1e219009abe62","answers":[{"text":"hermaphroditism and early reproduction","answer_start":983},{"text":"hermaphroditism and early reproduction","answer_start":983},{"text":"combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction","answer_start":968}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What a hermaphrodite?","id":"5726415bec44d21400f3dcd1","answers":[{"text":"a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm","answer_start":32},{"text":"a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm","answer_start":32},{"text":"a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm","answer_start":32}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What unique about  simultaneous hermaphrodites?","id":"5726415bec44d21400f3dcd2","answers":[{"text":"can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time.","answer_start":180},{"text":"can produce both eggs and sperm","answer_start":48},{"text":"produce both eggs and sperm at the same time","answer_start":184}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What a trait of sequential hermaphrodites?","id":"5726415bec44d21400f3dcd3","answers":[{"text":"the eggs and sperm mature at different times","answer_start":273},{"text":"eggs and sperm mature at different times","answer_start":277},{"text":"eggs and sperm mature at different times","answer_start":277}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which group keep the eggs are fertilized and kept inside the parent body until they hatch?","id":"5726415bec44d21400f3dcd4","answers":[{"text":"platyctenids","answer_start":362},{"text":"platyctenids","answer_start":362},{"text":"platyctenids","answer_start":362}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which group got young are born with no tentacles and a large mouth?","id":"5726415bec44d21400f3dcd5","answers":[{"text":"beroids","answer_start":614},{"text":"beroids","answer_start":614},{"text":"beroids","answer_start":614}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing a mate","answer_start":48}],"question":"How do plankton reproduce?","id":"5a834caae60761001a2eb539","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"external","answer_start":353}],"question":"How do plankton fertilize their eggs?","id":"5a834caae60761001a2eb53a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"gradually changing into their adult shapes","answer_start":554}],"question":"What happens to plankton when they mature?","id":"5a834caae60761001a2eb53b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"are capable of reproduction","answer_start":922}],"question":"When are some juvenile plankton able to do before becoming an adult?","id":"5a834caae60761001a2eb53c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"at an explosive rate","answer_start":1084}],"question":"How quickly do plankton populations grow due to hermaphrodism and early reproduction?","id":"5a834caae60761001a2eb53d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Most species are hermaphrodites\u2014a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing no mate.

Colloblasts specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and got three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) contain adhesive; a stalk anchor the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread coil round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk.

In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles \u2013 some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis tentilla got three types of movement are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle."},{"qas":[{"question":"What the bathocyroe and ocyropsis do to escape danger?","id":"57265c10f1498d1400e8dd36","answers":[{"text":"by clapping their lobes","answer_start":507},{"text":"clapping their lobes","answer_start":510},{"text":"clapping their lobes","answer_start":510}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happen when bathocyroe and ocyropsis clap their lobes together?","id":"57265c10f1498d1400e8dd37","answers":[{"text":"jet of expelled water drive them backwards very quickly.","answer_start":544},{"text":"jet of expelled water drive them backwards very quickly","answer_start":544},{"text":"expelled water drive them backwards very quickly","answer_start":551}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The movements of the lobates combs are controlled by what?","id":"57265c10f1498d1400e8dd38","answers":[{"text":"nerves","answer_start":669},{"text":"nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia","answer_start":669},{"text":"nerves","answer_start":669}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Cydippids combs are controlled by what?","id":"57265c10f1498d1400e8dd39","answers":[{"text":"water disturbances created by the cilia","answer_start":691},{"text":"water disturbances created by the cilia","answer_start":691},{"text":"water disturbances created by the cilia","answer_start":691}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"eight","answer_start":13}],"question":"How many lobes do cilia have?","id":"5a83878de60761001a2eb777","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"quite passive","answer_start":247}],"question":"How are most cilia when moving through the water?","id":"5a83878de60761001a2eb778","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"long and active","answer_start":366}],"question":"What kind of auricles do cilia have?","id":"5a83878de60761001a2eb779","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"by clapping their lobes","answer_start":515}],"question":"How do cilia and aboral escape from danger?","id":"5a83878de60761001a2eb77a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"drives them backwards very quickly","answer_start":574}],"question":"What happens when cilia and arbol clap their lobes?","id":"5a83878de60761001a2eb77b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Lobates got eight comb-rows, originating at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond no body to no lobes; in species with (four) auricles, the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia in four of the comb row.

Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: Pleurobrachia long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis generally feed on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae."},{"qas":[{"question":"Why ctenophores extremely rare as fossils?","id":"57268da7f1498d1400e8e39c","answers":[{"text":"Because of their soft, gelatinous bodies","answer_start":0},{"text":"their soft, gelatinous bodies","answer_start":11},{"text":"their soft, gelatinous bodies","answer_start":11}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Ediacaran eoandromeda can be regarded to represent what?","id":"57268da7f1498d1400e8e39d","answers":[{"text":"comb jelly.","answer_start":1192},{"text":"comb jelly","answer_start":1192},{"text":"a comb jelly","answer_start":1190}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the period called  done was 505 million years ago?","id":"57268da7f1498d1400e8e39e","answers":[{"text":"Cambrian period.","answer_start":553},{"text":"mid-Cambrian period","answer_start":549},{"text":"mid-Cambrian period","answer_start":549}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many species was found in the Burgess Shale?","id":"57268da7f1498d1400e8e39f","answers":[{"text":"Three additional putative species","answer_start":403},{"text":"Three","answer_start":403},{"text":"Three","answer_start":403}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the  fossils found in the Burgess Shale lack?","id":"57268da7f1498d1400e8e3a0","answers":[{"text":"lacked tentacles","answer_start":591},{"text":"tentacles","answer_start":598},{"text":"tentacles","answer_start":598}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"early Devonian (Emsian) period","answer_start":381}],"question":"When did the first tentacles form on ctenophores?","id":"5a839ccfe60761001a2eb81f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Three","answer_start":413}],"question":"How many prominent tentacles were found 1996?","id":"5a839ccfe60761001a2eb820","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"about 505 million years ago","answer_start":525}],"question":"How long ago was the Ediacaran period?","id":"5a839ccfe60761001a2eb821","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"internal organ-like structures","answer_start":732}],"question":"What kind of structures are typical in living lagerstatten?","id":"5a839ccfe60761001a2eb822","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1996","answer_start":852}],"question":"In what year was the Edicaran Eoandromeda named?","id":"5a839ccfe60761001a2eb823","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Because of their soft, gelatinous bodies, ctenophores extremely rare as fossils, and fossils done been interpreted as ctenophores done been found only in lagerst\u00e4tten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue.

A series of studies looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes done also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types was either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers done argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead.

Instead he found that various cydippid families was more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids ain't monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species was very small \u2013 so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggest that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished.

But X.25 do it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay do it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 require a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay do not define any such handshakes. X.25 do not define no operations inside the packet network. It only operate at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider free to use any procedure it wish inside the network. X.25 specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provide conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay a modified version of ISDN layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-no end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consist of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operate principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rid itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still got the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay make it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it do not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers gotta be correlated to network addresses. The same true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC\/LAPD\/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay done been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995>"}]},"14":{"title":"Black_Death","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What the mortality rate of the modern bubonic plague?","id":"57264d58f1498d1400e8db7a","answers":[{"text":"30\u201375%","answer_start":115},{"text":"30\u201375%","answer_start":115},{"text":"30\u201375%","answer_start":115}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How high plague fevers run?","id":"57264d58f1498d1400e8db7b","answers":[{"text":"100\u2013106 \u00b0F","answer_start":164},{"text":"38\u201341 \u00b0C","answer_start":154},{"text":"41 \u00b0C","answer_start":157}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What percent of untreated victims of the plague die within 8 days?","id":"57264d58f1498d1400e8db7c","answers":[{"text":"80 percent","answer_start":320},{"text":"80","answer_start":320},{"text":"80","answer_start":320}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the mortality rate of pneumonic plague?","id":"57264d58f1498d1400e8db7d","answers":[{"text":"90 to 95 percent","answer_start":395},{"text":"90 to 95","answer_start":395},{"text":"90 to 95 percent","answer_start":395}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What skin-related symptom appear from the pneumonic plague?","id":"57264d58f1498d1400e8db7e","answers":[{"text":"purple skin patch","answer_start":650},{"text":"purple skin patch","answer_start":650},{"text":"purple skin patch","answer_start":650}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"bright red","answer_start":533}],"question":"What color is the sputum of those suffering from septicemic plague sufferers?","id":"5a2ec98aa83784001a7d2477","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"100\u2013106 \u00b0F","answer_start":164}],"question":"What temperature fever does one have suffering from pneumonic plague?","id":"5a2ec98aa83784001a7d2478","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"38\u201341 \u00b0C","answer_start":154}],"question":"How high of a fever does someone suffering from septicemic plague have?","id":"5a2ec98aa83784001a7d2479","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"eight days","answer_start":347}],"question":"How fast does septicemic kill most people left untreated?","id":"5a2ec98aa83784001a7d247a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"eight days","answer_start":347}],"question":"How fast does pneumonic plague usually kill most people when left untreated?","id":"5a2ec98aa83784001a7d247b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Other forms of plague done been implicated by modern scientists.

In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110\u2013120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may done died from the disease as well. Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, dey was about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population done already perished.

Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season.

For a businessman got the profit motive as the prime interest, it a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers."},{"qas":[{"question":"What got the tendency to increase wages in a field or job position?","id":"5727ed2e3acd2414000df001","answers":[{"text":"Competition amongst workers","answer_start":309},{"text":"high demand","answer_start":544},{"text":"competition between employers for employees","answer_start":613}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When dey is many workers competing for a few jobs its considered as what?","id":"5727ed2e3acd2414000df002","answers":[{"text":"low demand","answer_start":118},{"text":"high supply","answer_start":72},{"text":"low wage","answer_start":146}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the potential earnings for a job where dey is few skilled workers but many available positions?","id":"5727ed2e3acd2414000df003","answers":[{"text":"high wages","answer_start":572},{"text":"high wages","answer_start":572},{"text":"high wages","answer_start":572}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What can lead to higher wages for members of labor organizations?","id":"5727ed2e3acd2414000df004","answers":[{"text":"collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption","answer_start":1124},{"text":"collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption","answer_start":1124},{"text":"collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption","answer_start":1124}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who work to get workers higher compensation?","id":"5727ed2e3acd2414000df005","answers":[{"text":"Professional and labor organizations","answer_start":946},{"text":"Professional and labor organizations","answer_start":946},{"text":"Professional and labor organizations","answer_start":946}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What many workers willing to work for a lot of time competing for a job only require a few workers result in?","id":"5729da0faf94a219006aa675","answers":[{"text":"low wage","answer_start":146},{"text":"competition","answer_start":185},{"text":"low wage","answer_start":146}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What drive down wages in a job with many workers willing to work a lot?","id":"5729da0faf94a219006aa676","answers":[{"text":"competition between workers","answer_start":185},{"text":"competition","answer_start":185},{"text":"competition","answer_start":185}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Why competition among workers drive down wages?","id":"5729da0faf94a219006aa677","answers":[{"text":"expendable nature of the worker","answer_start":373},{"text":"(high supply) competing for a job few require (low demand)","answer_start":71},{"text":"the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job","answer_start":369}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of wages result from jobs where dey is low supply but high demand?","id":"5729da0faf94a219006aa678","answers":[{"text":"high","answer_start":72},{"text":"high wages","answer_start":572},{"text":"high","answer_start":72}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"While competition between workers drive down wages for jobs with a high supply of worker, whose competition drive wages up for the inverse?","id":"5729da0faf94a219006aa679","answers":[{"text":"employers","answer_start":633},{"text":"employers","answer_start":633},{"text":"employers","answer_start":633}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Competition amongst workers","answer_start":319}],"question":"What has the tendency to decrease wages in a field or job position?","id":"5ad2467ad7d075001a428af6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"low demand","answer_start":126}],"question":"When there are many workers competing for a many jobs its considered as what?","id":"5ad2467ad7d075001a428af7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"high wages","answer_start":587}],"question":"What is the potential earnings for a job where there are many skilled workers but many available positions?","id":"5ad2467ad7d075001a428af8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption","answer_start":1149}],"question":"What can lead to lower wages for members of labor organizations?","id":"5ad2467ad7d075001a428af9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Professional and labor organizations","answer_start":970}],"question":"Who works to get workers lower compensation?","id":"5ad2467ad7d075001a428afa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"A job where dey is many workers willing to work a large amount of time (high supply) competing for a job few require (low demand) gon result in a low wage for that job.

He attribute this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concede that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade done only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality.

As with B cells, each type of T cell recognize a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor (TCR) bind to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8. The T cell then travel throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it release cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pore in the target cell plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induce the target cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cells particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation done conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires was built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"done come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions the core and the periphery. The core consist of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics done led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world.

The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. The \u0141azienki Park cover the area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What make this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carps in the pond. The Wilan\u00f3w Palace Park, date back to the second half of the 17th century. It cover the area of 43 ha. Its central French-styled area correspond to the ancient, baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond. The park around the Kr\u00f3likarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula. The park got lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace."},{"qas":[{"question":"What the basic unit of territorial division in Poland?","id":"573380e0d058e614000b5be9","answers":[{"text":"a commune","answer_start":49},{"text":"commune","answer_start":51},{"text":"commune","answer_start":51}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the second level of territorial division in Poland?","id":"573380e0d058e614000b5bea","answers":[{"text":"counties or powiats","answer_start":412},{"text":"counties or powiats","answer_start":412},{"text":"counties or powiats","answer_start":412}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In what districts are the registration numbers for cars all of the same type?","id":"573380e0d058e614000b5beb","answers":[{"text":"Krak\u00f3w","answer_start":721},{"text":"Krak\u00f3w","answer_start":721}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a commune","answer_start":86}],"question":"What is the basic unit of territorial division in Warsaw?","id":"5ad4f40c5b96ef001a10a774","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"counties or powiats","answer_start":421}],"question":"What is the second level of territorial division in Warsaw?","id":"5ad4f40c5b96ef001a10a775","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Krak\u00f3w","answer_start":1085}],"question":"In what districts are the registration numbers for boats all of the same type?","id":"5ad4f40c5b96ef001a10a776","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"city charter.","answer_start":111}],"question":"What does a car have besides a commune?","id":"5ad4f40c5b96ef001a10a777","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Warsaw","answer_start":760}],"question":"What city has districts with no powiat entitlements?","id":"5ad4f40c5b96ef001a10a778","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The basic unit of territorial division in Poland a commune (gmina).

From the perspective of the object, all motion occur as if dey was no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years).
