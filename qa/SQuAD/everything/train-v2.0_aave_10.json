friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They was placed into a group with three other girls as Girl Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl Tyme failed to win, and Beyonc\u00e9 later said the song they performed ain't good. In 1995 Beyonc\u00e9 father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyonc\u00e9 family income by half, and her parents was forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and was finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyonc\u00e9 parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records."},{"qas":[{"question":"Beyonce got married in 2008 to whom?","id":"56be95823aeaaa14008c910c","answers":[{"text":"Jay Z","answer_start":34}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Her third album, \"I am...Sasha Fierce\" was released when?","id":"56be95823aeaaa14008c910d","answers":[{"text":"November 18, 2008","answer_start":251}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"For which decade, Beyonce have more top ten songs than any other woman?","id":"56be95823aeaaa14008c910e","answers":[{"text":"2000s","answer_start":889}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which singer beat out Beyonce for best video performance?","id":"56be95823aeaaa14008c910f","answers":[{"text":"Taylor Swift","answer_start":1560}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In 2009, Beyonce started her second world tour and grossed how much money?","id":"56be95823aeaaa14008c9110","answers":[{"text":"119.5 million","answer_start":1870}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How she reveal the marriage?","id":"56bf97aba10cfb140055119e","answers":[{"text":"in a video montage","answer_start":78}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When Beyonce begin her second world tour?","id":"56bf97aba10cfb140055119f","answers":[{"text":"March 2009","answer_start":1733}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who beat out Beyonce for Best Female Video ?","id":"56bf97aba10cfb14005511a0","answers":[{"text":"Taylor Swift","answer_start":1560}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much the second world tour make in dollars?","id":"56bf97aba10cfb14005511a1","answers":[{"text":"119.5 million","answer_start":1870}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When Beyonc\u00e9 get married?","id":"56d4bf242ccc5a1400d831be","answers":[{"text":"April 4, 2008","answer_start":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who Beyonc\u00e9 marry?","id":"56d4bf242ccc5a1400d831bf","answers":[{"text":"Jay Z.","answer_start":34}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who Beyonc\u00e9 alter ego?","id":"56d4bf242ccc5a1400d831c0","answers":[{"text":"Sasha Fierce","answer_start":156}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The video for what song won Beyonc\u00e9 the 2009 MTV Video of the Year award?","id":"56d4bf242ccc5a1400d831c1","answers":[{"text":"Single Ladies","answer_start":600}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which prominent star felt the 2009 Female Video of the Year award should done went to Beyonc\u00e9 instead of Taylor Swift?","id":"56d4bf242ccc5a1400d831c2","answers":[{"text":"Kanye West","answer_start":1602}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"On April 4, 2008, Beyonc\u00e9 married Jay Z.

The second successor of this first Tsang king, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, took control of the whole of Central Tibet (\u00dc-Tsang), reigning from 1611\u20131621. Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Gelug, while the \u00dc-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa. Tensions rose between the nationalistic \u00dc-Tsang ruler and the Mongols safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the \u00dc-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Gelug monasteries. Chen write of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama mysterious death and the plot of the \u00dc-Tsang king to have him murdered for \"cursing\" him with illness, although Chen write that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle. In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso done died, the Gelug and the Karma Kargyu went to war, the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular \u00dc-Tsang king. The \u00dc-Tsang ruler had a large number of Gelugpa lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at Drepung and Sera, and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama. In 1621, the \u00dc-Tsang king died and was succeeded by his young son Karma Tenkyong, an event which stymied the war effort as the latter accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new Dalai Lama. Despite the new Dalai Lama diplomatic efforts to maintain friendly relations with the new \u00dc-Tsang ruler, Sonam Rapten (1595\u20131657), the Dalai Lama chief steward and treasurer at Drepung, made efforts to overthrow the \u00dc-Tsang king, which led to another conflict.

In a lukewarm review for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, describing Spectre as inconsistent and unable to capitalise on its potential. Kenneth Turan, reviewing the film for Los Angeles Times, concluded that Spectre \"come off as exhausted and uninspired\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times panned the film as having \"nothing surprising\" and sacrificing its originality for the sake of box office returns. Forbes Scott Mendelson also heavily criticised the film, denouncing Spectre as \"the worst 007 movie in 30 years\". Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly viewed Spectre as \"an overreaction to our current blockbuster moment\", aspiring \"to be a serialized sequel\" and proving \"itself as a Saga\". While noting that \"[n]othing happen in Spectre hold up to even minor logical scrutiny\", he done \"come not to bury Spectre, but to weirdly praise it. Because the final act of the movie so strange, so willfully obtuse, that it deserve extra attention.\" In a positive review Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing \"The 24th movie about the British MI6 agent with a license to kill is party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies\". Other positive reviews from Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle, gave it a perfect 100 score, stating: \u201cOne of the great satisfactions of Spectre is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person.\u201d Stephen Whitty from the New York Daily News, gave it an 80 grade, saying: \u201cCraig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista make a good, Oddjob-like assassin.

This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues.

Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside. 2 and 3 pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (Ecl. 2) and attraction toward people of any gender (Ecl. 3). Eclogue 4, addressed to Asinius Pollio, the so-called \"Messianic Eclogue\" use the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be have been subject to debate). 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus.

Some theories of pitch perception hold that pitch got inherent octave ambiguities, and therefore best decomposed into a pitch chroma, a periodic value around the octave, like the note names in western music\u2014and a pitch height, which may be ambiguous, that indicate the octave the pitch is in."}]},"106":{"title":"England_national_football_team","paragraphs":[]},"107":{"title":"Houston","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Who the current mayor of Houston?","id":"5709517c9928a81400471528","answers":[{"text":"Sylvester Turner","answer_start":286}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What form of government Houston have?","id":"5709517c9928a81400471529","answers":[{"text":"strong mayoral form of municipal government","answer_start":26}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who Houston elected officials?","id":"5709517c9928a8140047152a","answers":[{"text":"the mayor, city controller and 16 members of the Houston City Council","answer_start":186}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What Houston mayor also serve as?","id":"5709517c9928a8140047152b","answers":[{"text":"the city chief administrator, executive officer, and official representative","answer_start":371}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Besides the general management of the city, Houston mayor also responsible for what?","id":"5709517c9928a8140047152c","answers":[{"text":"seeing that all laws and ordinances are enforced","answer_start":512}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the form of city  government in Houston?","id":"5709c638200fba14003682e1","answers":[{"text":"strong mayoral","answer_start":26}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of municipal elections are held in Texas?","id":"5709c638200fba14003682e2","answers":[{"text":"nonpartisan","answer_start":146}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Besides the mayor and controller, how many members there on the city council?","id":"5709c638200fba14003682e3","answers":[{"text":"16","answer_start":217}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who the mayor of Houston since the last election?","id":"5709c638200fba14003682e4","answers":[{"text":"Sylvester Turner","answer_start":286}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"To what political party is Mayor Turner aligned?","id":"5709c638200fba14003682e5","answers":[{"text":"Democrat","answer_start":306}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Sylvester Turner","answer_start":302}],"question":" Who is the current senator of Houston?","id":"5ad422ad604f3c001a4007d7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"strong mayoral form of municipal","answer_start":26}],"question":" What form of government does Texas have?","id":"5ad422ad604f3c001a4007d8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"mayor, city controller and 16 members of the Houston City Council","answer_start":203}],"question":" Who are Texas's elected officials?","id":"5ad422ad604f3c001a4007d9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"city's chief administrator","answer_start":394}],"question":" What does Houston's senator also serve as?","id":"5ad422ad604f3c001a4007da","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The city of Houston got a strong mayoral form of municipal government.

The history of copper metallurgy is thought to done followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appear more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500\u20134000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating done established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. \u00d6tzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300\u20133200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting.

At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary gon also impose restrictions on the people it done included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages.

This important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which play a major role in bonding.

These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information is encoded in the DNA sequences provide the blueprint for assembling proteins make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits done enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material done been modified. This suggest that everything separate us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students study animal behaviors done only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences done been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene correspond to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005). Another potential example with behavioral differences the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and have been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans (Enard et al. 2002).

Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients was unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions was thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scan the area, to explain the pounding, and notice the bear. Consequently, the brain interpret the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine.

While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into emotion, the more modern branch of computer science originated with Rosalind Picard 1995 paper on affective computing. Detecting emotional information begin with passive sensors which capture data about the user physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others.

With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there would block American expansion. The United States finally done declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. done officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh War and the Creek War) was more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the burning of Washington on 25 August 1814, but was repulsed in their Chesapeake Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander killed. The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one-sided military battle killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers. The winners was the commanding general of the Battle of New Orleans, Major General Andrew Jackson, became president and the Americans basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation. The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and Britain never again went to war.

Among the most successful acts was the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia Silverchair and England Bush, all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s.

Being a member of these inner circles brought huge advantages, as it was easier to gain favour from the king, file lawsuits, marry a wealthy heiress or have one debts remitted. By the time of Henry II, these posts was increasingly being filled by \"new men\" from outside the normal ranks of the barons. This intensified under John rule, with many lesser nobles arriving from the continent to take up positions at court; many was mercenary leaders from Poitou. These men included soldiers would become infamous in England for their uncivilised behaviour, including Falkes de Breaut\u00e9, Geard d'Athies, Engelard de Cigong\u00e9 and Philip Marc.

They commented on the paucity of John charitable donations to the church. Historian Frank McLynn argue that John early years at Fontevrault, combined with his relatively advanced education, may done turned him against the church.

Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirm a normative process of change in both content and structure of one thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence gon lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers done used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body go through changes.

He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in no time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion done played a major role when it come to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which correspond with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers.

Girls most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, they more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys.

Throughout the entire PC industry, decline in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers (a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory). As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins.

Wilson and Reill note that, \"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they was vocal critics of Christianity, was true atheists. Rather, they was critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God punish evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they was far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647\u20131706) observed that in his day, \"prudent persons gon always maintain an appearance of [religion].\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if dey was no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself.

Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation game consoles done acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector wrought quite well when both the connector and the cartridges was clean and the pins on the connector was new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector ain't truly zero insertion no force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues was not alleviated by Nintendo choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors was also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing."}]},"163":{"title":"Athanasius_of_Alexandria","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where is Gaul currently located?","id":"571aa5df10f8ca1400305259","answers":[{"text":"Belgium \/ Holland and surrounding areas","answer_start":116}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"With whom Athanasius travel to Sardica?","id":"571aa5df10f8ca140030525a","answers":[{"text":"Hosius of Cordoba","answer_start":163}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"About what done did the Council of the Church question Athanasius?","id":"571aa5df10f8ca140030525b","answers":[{"text":"misdemeanours and even murder","answer_start":576}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Was Athanasius permitted admission to the Council?","id":"571aa5df10f8ca140030525c","answers":[{"text":"objections was overridden by the orthodox bishops","answer_start":1287}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the verdict at the Council of Sardica?","id":"571aa5df10f8ca140030525d","answers":[{"text":"his innocence reaffirmed","answer_start":1709}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Belgium","answer_start":115}],"question":"Where is Gaul not currently located?","id":"5aceb9df32bba1001ae4b1e3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Hosius of Cordoba","answer_start":162}],"question":" With whom did Athanasius travel to Africa?","id":"5aceb9df32bba1001ae4b1e4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"misdemeanours","answer_start":577}],"question":" About what did the Council of the Church question Julius?","id":"5aceb9df32bba1001ae4b1e5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Athanasius","answer_start":2324}],"question":"Who was found guilty?","id":"5aceb9df32bba1001ae4b1e6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Early in the year 343 we find Athanasius done travelled, via Rome, from Alexandria, North Africa, to Gaul; nowadays Belgium \/ Holland and surrounding areas, where Hosius of Cordoba was Bishop, the great champion of orthodoxy in the West.

An experimental study by German cognitive psychologists L. Schwabe and O. Wolf demonstrate how learning under stress also decrease memory recall in humans. In this study, 48 healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group.

Both the stress and control groups was then presented with 32 words to memorize. Twenty-four hours later, both groups was tested to see how many words they could remember (free recall) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words (recognition performance). The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group, recalled 30% fewer words than the control group.

Therefore, sleep got the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhance the brain abilities to stabilize and retain memories. dey have been several studies which show that sleep improve the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation take place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicate that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn\u2019t enhance no memory. It also implicate that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replay the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then review and processes memories, which move them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it make it more difficult to learn as these neural connections ain't as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation make it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning. Furthermore, some studies done shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories ain't properly transferred to long-term no memory. Therefore, it important to get the proper amount of sleep so that memory can function at the highest level. One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies done demonstrated that memory depend on getting sufficient sleep between training and test. Additionally, data obtained from neuroimaging studies done shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day, suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal."},{"qas":[{"question":"What a term to describe memory loss?","id":"571a7a2810f8ca140030508d","answers":[{"text":"amnesia.","answer_start":95}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What diseases can have a major imact on memory?","id":"571a7a2810f8ca140030508e","answers":[{"text":"Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease","answer_start":768}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What Korsakoff syndrome?","id":"571a7a2810f8ca140030508f","answers":[{"text":"an organic brain disease adversely affect memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex.","answer_start":1121}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Amnesia only seen in one form?","id":"571a7a2810f8ca1400305090","answers":[{"text":"dey is many sorts of amnesia,","answer_start":488}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happen to a person whose autobiographic memory is damaged?","id":"571a7a2810f8ca1400305091","answers":[{"text":"that they cannot forget small details otherwise would not be stored","answer_start":965}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"amnesia","answer_start":130}],"question":"What is a term to describe memory gain?","id":"5a8ce73afd22b3001a8d8fec","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease","answer_start":771}],"question":"What diseases does not have a major impact on memory?","id":"5a8ce73afd22b3001a8d8fed","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex","answer_start":1151}],"question":"What is Alzheimer's syndrome?","id":"5a8ce73afd22b3001a8d8fee","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"There are many sorts of amnesia","answer_start":487}],"question":"Why is amnesia only seen in one form?","id":"5a8ce73afd22b3001a8d8fef","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored","answer_start":988}],"question":"What happens to a person whose biographic memory is damaged?","id":"5a8ce73afd22b3001a8d8ff0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Much of the current knowledge of memory done come from studying memory disorders, particularly amnesia.

The researchers found that the people was asked, \"How fast was the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those was asked, \"How fast was the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they done seen broken glass in the film, those done been asked the question with smashed was twice more likely to report that they done seen broken glass than those done been asked the question with hit. dey was no broken glass depicted in the film. Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers memories of the event. Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event \u2013 those was asked the question with smashed recalled a more serious car accident than they done actually seen. The findings of this experiment was replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people was provided with misleading information they done tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect."}]},"166":{"title":"Multiracial_American","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Who was not identified by name on the census before the civil war?","id":"571de3ebb64a571400c71dd8","answers":[{"text":"slaves","answer_start":255}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was Thomas Jefferson in a relationship with?","id":"571de3ebb64a571400c71dd9","answers":[{"text":"Sally Hemings","answer_start":508}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Not recognizing white fatherhood for multiracial slave children cause what to be lost?","id":"571de3ebb64a571400c71dda","answers":[{"text":"paternity","answer_start":593}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who ain't gon reveal full ancestral data to mixed race no people","id":"571de3ebb64a571400c71ddb","answers":[{"text":"elder family members","answer_start":78}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"people of mixed African-American and Native American descent","answer_start":10}],"question":"What people report having elder family members who were open with genealogical information?","id":"5ad2b36bd7d075001a429f90","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Tracing the genealogy of African Americans","answer_start":158}],"question":"What is usually a very easy process?","id":"5ad2b36bd7d075001a429f91","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"censuses","answer_start":237}],"question":"What identified slaves by name before the American Civil War?","id":"5ad2b36bd7d075001a429f92","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"white fathers","answer_start":404}],"question":"Who acknowledged their mixed-race slave children in records?","id":"5ad2b36bd7d075001a429f93","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Sally Hemings","answer_start":516}],"question":"Who was John Adams in a relationship with?","id":"5ad2b36bd7d075001a429f94","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Sometimes people of mixed African-American and Native American descent report elder family members withholding pertinent genealogical information.

The study also observed that Ashkenazim are more diverse than their Middle Eastern relatives, which was counterintuitive because Ashkenazim are supposed to be a subset, not a superset, of their assumed geographical source population.

Ashkenazim distinctiveness as found in the Bray et al. study, therefore, may come from their ethnic endogamy (ethnic inbreeding), which allowed them to \"mine\" their ancestral gene pool in the context of relative reproductive isolation from European neighbors, and not from clan endogamy (clan inbreeding).

While the earliest mammals was probably predators, different species done since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals \u2013 this is a carnivorous diet (and include insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. A herbivorous diet include subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eat both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals got a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore therefore host to bacteria fermented these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. The size of an animal also a factor in determining diet type. Since small mammals got a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals weigh less than about 18 oz (500 g) mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of a herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (those prey on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). Furthermore, mammals weigh more than 18 oz (500 g) usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves.

The number of successful interspecific mammalian hybrids is relatively small, although it done come to be known that dey is a significant number of naturally occurring hybrids between forms or regional varieties of a single species.[citation needed] These may form zones of gradation known as clines. Indeed, the distinction between some hitherto distinct species can become clouded once it can be shown that they may not only breed but produce fertile offspring. Some hybrid animals exhibit greater strength and resilience than either parent. This is known as hybrid vigor. The existence of the mule (donkey sire; horse dam) being used widely as a hardy draught animal throughout ancient and modern history testament to this. Other well known examples are the lion\/tiger hybrid, the liger, which by far the largest big cat and sometimes used in circuses; and cattle hybrids such as between European and Indian domestic cattle or between domestic cattle and American bison, which are used in the meat industry and marketed as Beefalo. dey is some speculation that the donkey itself may be the result of an ancient hybridisation between two wild ass species or sub-species. Hybrid animals normally infertile partly because their parents usually got slightly different numbers of chromosomes, resulting in unpaired chromosomes in their cells, which prevent division of sex cells and the gonads from operating correctly, particularly in males. dey is exceptions to this rule, especially if the speciation process was relatively recent or incomplete as is the case with many cattle and dog species. Normally behavior traits, natural hostility, natural ranges and breeding cycle differences maintain the separateness of closely related species and prevent natural hybridisation. However, the widespread disturbances to natural animal behaviours and range caused by human activity, cities, dumping grounds with food, agriculture, fencing, roads and so on force animals together which would not normally breed. Clear examples exist between the various sub-species of grey wolf, coyote and domestic dog in North America. As many birds and mammals imprint on their mother and immediate family from infancy, a practice used by animal hybridizers is to foster a planned parent in a hybridization program with the same species as the one with which they are planned to mate."}]},"189":{"title":"East_India_Company","paragraphs":[]},"190":{"title":"Hokkien","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Most Hokkein morphemes got what type of characters?","id":"5726c95cf1498d1400e8eb30","answers":[{"text":"standard designated","answer_start":33}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In some cases, charcters are invented to represent what?","id":"5726c95cf1498d1400e8eb31","answers":[{"text":"a particular morpheme","answer_start":218}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Hokkien morphemes ain't always what?","id":"5726c95cf1498d1400e8eb32","answers":[{"text":"etymological or phono-semantic","answer_start":83}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are often borrowed to represent a particular morpheme?","id":"5726c95cf1498d1400e8eb33","answers":[{"text":"Similar-sounding, similar-meaning or rare characters","answer_start":115}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Similar-sounding, similar-meaning or rare characters","answer_start":118}],"question":"What are borrowed in Taiwanese to represent a certain morpheme?","id":"5a1e20f93de3f40018b264dc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"multiple and unrelated pronunciations","answer_start":874}],"question":"What do some literary readings have to represent Hokkien words?","id":"5a1e20f93de3f40018b264dd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"standard designated","answer_start":34}],"question":"What type of characters do most colloquial mophemes have?","id":"5a1e20f93de3f40018b264de","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"they are not always etymological or phono-semantic.","answer_start":66}],"question":"What characteristic do personal pronouns not always have?","id":"5a1e20f93de3f40018b264df","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"characters","answer_start":693}],"question":"What are invented to represent a multiple and unrelated pronunciation?","id":"5a1e20f93de3f40018b264e0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"While most Hokkien morphemes got standard designated characters, they ain't always etymological or phono-semantic.

Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often result in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey tissue through consumption. Thus predation often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continue to live in or on its decaying corpse after it done died. The key characteristic of predation however the predator direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and got no direct impact on the \"donor\" organism(s)."},{"qas":[{"question":"What household animals prey upon?","id":"57265fdcf1498d1400e8dd9c","answers":[{"text":"large and small prey","answer_start":587}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Name an exemplar of an predator use digestion to kill and gain nutrients from it's prey.","id":"57265fdcf1498d1400e8dd9d","answers":[{"text":"Baleen whales","answer_start":1200}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"To be classified as a predator, what action must be performed?","id":"57265fdcf1498d1400e8dd9e","answers":[{"text":"harm their prey in some way","answer_start":116}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What different about a true predator?","id":"5726c98cdd62a815002e903e","answers":[{"text":"Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kill them","answer_start":80}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"All types of predators do what?","id":"5726c98cdd62a815002e903f","answers":[{"text":"harm their prey in some way","answer_start":116}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How ambush predators hunt?","id":"5726c98cdd62a815002e9040","answers":[{"text":"sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance","answer_start":228}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What box jellyfish use to hunt their pray?","id":"5726c98cdd62a815002e9041","answers":[{"text":"venom","answer_start":798}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"sit and wait","answer_start":236}],"question":"What is one thing prey can do if they know a predator is approaching?","id":"5a6b99e1a9e0c9001a4e9fae","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"another living thing","answer_start":65}],"question":"What do prey sometimes consume as food?","id":"5a6b99e1a9e0c9001a4e9faf","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"chew it","answer_start":368}],"question":"What do rabbits like to do with their food when foraging?","id":"5a6b99e1a9e0c9001a4e9fb0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"hunt actively","answer_start":188}],"question":"What do large insects do at night after the sun goes down?","id":"5a6b99e1a9e0c9001a4e9fb1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"grazing","answer_start":1653}],"question":"What have cats sometimes been seen doing in the yard of their home?","id":"5a6b99e1a9e0c9001a4e9fb2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"A true predator can commonly be known as one kill and eat another living thing.

Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as do a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entail venom subdue a prey creature before the predator ingest the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish do, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contribute to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begin eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale. Seed predation and egg predation other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat no prey entirely.

Secondary consumers a type of carnivore, but dey is also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom go higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion prey upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses).

If a predator overhunt its prey, the prey population gon lower to numbers too scarce for the predators to find. This gon cause the predator population to dip, decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population. The decrease in predators gon allow the small number of prey left to slowly increase their population to somewhere around their previous abundance, which gon allow the predator population to increase in response to the greater availability of resources. If a predator hunt its prey species to numbers too low to sustain the population in the short term, they can cause not only the extinction or extirpation of the prey but also the extinction of their own species, a phenomenon known as coextinction. This a risk wildlife conservationists encounter when introducing predators to prey done not coevolved with the same or similar predators. This possibility depend largely on how well and how fast the prey species is able to adapt to the introduced predator. One way that this risk can be avoided is if the predator find an alternative prey species or if an alternative prey species is introduced (something ecologists and environmentalists try to avoid whenever possible). An alternative prey species would help to lift some of the predation pressure from the initial prey species, giving the population a chance to recover, however it does not guarantee that the initial prey species gon be able to recover as the initial prey population may done been hunted to below sustainable numbers or to complete extinction."}]},"205":{"title":"Marvel_Comics","paragraphs":[]},"206":{"title":"British_Empire","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What done turned England and Catholic Spain into implacable enemies?","id":"57266351708984140094c47d","answers":[{"text":"the Protestant Reformation","answer_start":184}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When John Hawkins and Francis Drake attack Spanish and Portuguese slave ships?","id":"57266351708984140094c47e","answers":[{"text":"1562","answer_start":279}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where John Hawkins and Francis Drake attack Spanish and Portuguese slave ships?","id":"57266351708984140094c47f","answers":[{"text":"off the coast of West Africa","answer_start":432}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who gave their blessing further privateering raids against Spanish ports?","id":"57266351708984140094c480","answers":[{"text":"Elizabeth I","answer_start":110}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which author was the first to use the term \"British Empire\"?","id":"57266351708984140094c481","answers":[{"text":"John Dee","answer_start":847}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"No further attempts to establish English colonies in the Americas was made until well into the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, during the last decades of the 16th century.

This allow the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal, diffusing into the iron matrix. When this happen, the carbon atoms are said to be in solution, or mixed with the iron, forming a single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called austenite. If the steel is cooled slowly, the iron gon gradually change into its low temperature allotrope. When this happen the carbon atoms gon no longer be soluble with the iron, and gon be forced to precipitate out of solution, nucleating into the spaces between the crystals. The steel then become heterogeneous, being formed of two phases; the carbon (carbide) phase cementite, and ferrite. This type of heat treatment produce steel rather soft and bendable.

George Canning believed that Burke Reflections \"done been justified by the course of subsequent events; and almost every prophecy done been strictly fulfilled\".

In the 1880s, many inventors was tryna develop workable AC motors because AC advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission was counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC. The first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors was independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla, a working motor model been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887. In 1888, the Royal Academy of Science of Turin published Ferraris research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that \"the apparatus based on that principle could ain't of any commercial importance as motor.\" In 1888, Tesla presented his paper A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers to the AIEE described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding. One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. George Westinghouse promptly bought Tesla patents, employed Tesla to develop them, and assigned C. F. Scott to help Tesla, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889.  The constant speed AC induction motor was found to ain't suitable for street cars but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride, Colorado in 1891. Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890. This type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications. However, he claimed that Tesla motor ain't practical because of two-phase no pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work. Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, these early Westinghouse motors was two-phase motors with wound rotors until B. G. Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor. The General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the squirrel-cage rotor. Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations was such that a 100 horsepower (HP) induction motor currently got the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 HP motor in 1897."},{"qas":[{"question":"How is RFI generated?","id":"5726ae3cdd62a815002e8cce","answers":[{"text":"sparking","answer_start":588}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What brushes gotta be in contact with?","id":"5726ae3cdd62a815002e8ccf","answers":[{"text":"commutator","answer_start":39}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is created by contact between parts of the motor?","id":"5726ae3cdd62a815002e8cd0","answers":[{"text":"friction","answer_start":132}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What sparking limit?","id":"5726ae3cdd62a815002e8cd1","answers":[{"text":"maximum speed","answer_start":637}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What motor components most need replacement and maintenance?","id":"5726ae3cdd62a815002e8cd2","answers":[{"text":"Brushes","answer_start":958}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Sparks","answer_start":147}],"question":"How is RFID generated?","id":"5ad160f9645df0001a2d1918","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"commutator","answer_start":283}],"question":" What don't brushes need to be in contact with?","id":"5ad160f9645df0001a2d1919","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"voltage","answer_start":524}],"question":" What is not created by contact between parts of the motor?","id":"5ad160f9645df0001a2d191a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"maximum speed","answer_start":645}],"question":" What does sparking not limit?","id":"5ad160f9645df0001a2d191b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Brushes","answer_start":970}],"question":"What motor components least need replacement and maintenance?","id":"5ad160f9645df0001a2d191c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Many of the limitations of the classic commutator DC motor due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator.

Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections \u2013 and hence coil end \u2013 momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the inductance of the rotor coils cause the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limit the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking gon overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their resistivity, limit the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generate electrical noise; sparking generate RFI. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself subject wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors).

Recently, some researchers suggested an interesting theory of evolution of dietary antioxidants. Some are produced by the human body with adequate precursors (glutathione, Vitamin C), and those the body cannot produce may only be obtained in the diet via direct sources (Vitamin C in humans, Vitamin A, Vitamin K) or produced by the body from other compounds (Beta-carotene converted to Vitamin A by the body, Vitamin D synthesized from cholesterol by sunlight). Phytochemicals (Section Below) and their subgroup, polyphenols, make up the majority of antioxidants; about 4,000 are known. Different antioxidants are now known to function in a cooperative network. For example, Vitamin C can reactivate free radical-containing glutathione or Vitamin E by accepting the free radical itself. Some antioxidants more effective than others at neutralizing different free radicals. Some cannot neutralize certain free radicals. Some canain't present in certain areas of free radical development (Vitamin A is fat-soluble and protect fat areas, Vitamin C is water-soluble and protect those areas). When interacting with a free radical, some antioxidants produce a different free radical compound less dangerous or more dangerous than the previous compound.

A rebuttal to this might be that as nonprofit organizations grow and seek larger donations, the degree of scrutiny increases, including expectations of audited financial statements. A further rebuttal might be that NPOs are constrained, by their choice of legal structure, from financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to its members\/directors is concerned. Beware of board-only organizations- review the board members annual income before donating, such as the Clinton Foundation.

The plot is for more than just entertainment purposes; within it lie information about economics, psychology, science, religions, politics, cultures, and social depth. Studying and analyzing literature become very important in terms of learning about our history. Through the study of past literature we able to learn about how society done evolved and about the societal norms during each of the different periods all throughout history. This can even help us to understand references made in more modern literature because authors often make references to Greek mythology and other old religious texts or historical moments. Not only is dey literature written on each of the aforementioned topics themselves, and how they done evolved throughout history (like a book about the history of economics or a book about evolution and science, for example) but we can also learn about these things in fictional works. Authors often include historical moments in their works, like when Lord Byron talk about the Spanish and the French in \u2018\u2018Childe Harold Pilgrimage: Canto I\u2019\u2019 and express his opinions through his character Childe Harold. Through literature we able to continuously uncover new information about history. It easy to see how all academic fields got roots in literature. Information became easier to pass down from generation to generation once we began to write it down. Eventually everything was written down, from things like home remedies and cures for illness, or how to build shelter to traditions and religious practices. From there people was able to study literature, improve on ideas, further our knowledge, and academic fields such as the medical field or trades could be started.

Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which play the St. George Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs have long been mostly civilian)."}]},"239":{"title":"Nigeria","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What region done Nigeria traded with for centuries?","id":"5726c29a5951b619008f7d7b","answers":[{"text":"North Africa","answer_start":87}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which countries explorers was the first Europeans to trade with Nigeria?","id":"5726c29a5951b619008f7d7c","answers":[{"text":"Spanish and Portuguese","answer_start":246}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Calabar is on which historical Bight?","id":"5726c29a5951b619008f7d7d","answers":[{"text":"Biafra","answer_start":601}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the current name of the Bight of Biafra?","id":"5726c29a5951b619008f7d7e","answers":[{"text":"Bight of Bonny","answer_start":641}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was the major slave traders through Nigeria from the southwest?","id":"5726c29a5951b619008f7d7f","answers":[{"text":"Oyo Empire","answer_start":1331}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"For centuries, various peoples in modern-day Nigeria traded overland with traders from North Africa.

In the 16th century, Spanish and Portuguese explorers was the first Europeans to begin significant, direct trade with peoples of modern-day Nigeria, at the port they named Lagos and in Calabar. Europeans traded goods with peoples at the coast; coastal trade with Europeans also marked the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade. The port of Calabar on the historical Bight of Biafra (now commonly referred to as the Bight of Bonny) become one of the largest slave trading posts in West Africa in the era of the transatlantic slave trade. Other major slaving ports in Nigeria was located in Badagry, Lagos on the Bight of Benin and on Bonny Island on the Bight of Biafra. The majority of those enslaved and taken to these ports was captured in raids and wars. Usually the captives was taken back to the conquerors territory as forced labour; after time, they was sometimes acculturated and absorbed into the conquerors society. A number of slave routes was established throughout Nigeria linking the hinterland areas with the major coastal ports. Some of the more prolific slave traders was linked with the Oyo Empire in the southwest, the Aro Confederacy in the southeast and the Sokoto Caliphate in the north."},{"qas":[{"question":"What type of vegetation is in central Nigeria?","id":"5726e30ddd62a815002e93f8","answers":[{"text":"savannah","answer_start":54}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many inches of rain central Nigeria get each year?","id":"5726e30ddd62a815002e93f9","answers":[{"text":"between 500 and 1,500 millimetres (20 and 60 in)","answer_start":165}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many subregions there of Nigeria savannah zone?","id":"5726e30ddd62a815002e93fa","answers":[{"text":"three","answer_start":242}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much rain the Sahel savannah area get per year?","id":"5726e30ddd62a815002e93fb","answers":[{"text":"less than 500 millimetres (20 in)","answer_start":569}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which desert is encroaching into northeastern Nigeria?","id":"5726e30ddd62a815002e93fc","answers":[{"text":"Sahara","answer_start":620}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Everything in between the far south and the far north savannah (insignificant tree cover, with grasses and flowers located between trees).

Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signalled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British\u2013French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with no baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov dismissal helped the Soviets with British\u2013French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions."}]},"242":{"title":"Capacitor","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What benefit is offered by solid state paper capacitors?","id":"572711cff1498d1400e8f30a","answers":[{"text":"relatively high voltage performance","answer_start":152}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of capacitor done mostly replaced solid state paper capacitors?","id":"572711cff1498d1400e8f30b","answers":[{"text":"plastic film capacitors","answer_start":268}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What sort of circuit plastic capacitors especially useful for?","id":"572711cff1498d1400e8f30c","answers":[{"text":"timer circuits","answer_start":375}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What one type of reliable capacitor resistant to temperature and voltage changes?","id":"572711cff1498d1400e8f30d","answers":[{"text":"Glass","answer_start":806}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What another type of reliable capacitor resistant to temperature and voltage changes?","id":"572711cff1498d1400e8f30e","answers":[{"text":"mica capacitors","answer_start":816}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"relatively high voltage performance","answer_start":157}],"question":" What benefit is never offered by solid state paper capacitors?","id":"5acf67fb77cf76001a684d94","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"plastic film capacitors","answer_start":275}],"question":" What type of capacitor has not replaced solid state paper capacitors?","id":"5acf67fb77cf76001a684d95","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"timer circuits","answer_start":383}],"question":" What sort of circuit are plastic capacitors not useful for?","id":"5acf67fb77cf76001a684d96","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Glass","answer_start":821}],"question":"What is one type of reliable capacitor that is non-resistant to temperature and voltage changes?","id":"5acf67fb77cf76001a684d97","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"mica capacitors","answer_start":831}],"question":" What is another type of reliable capacitor that is not resistant to temperature and voltage changes?","id":"5acf67fb77cf76001a684d98","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Several solid dielectrics available, including paper, plastic, glass, mica and ceramic materials.

Like Frontier, Savers got no connection with the previous installments, and also mark a new start for the Digimon franchise, with a drastic change in character designs and story-line, in order to reach a broader audience. The story focus on the challenges faced by the members of D.A.T.S. (\"Digital Accident Tactics Squad\"), an organization created to conceal the existence of the Digital World and Digimon from the rest of mankind, and secretly solve any Digimon-related incidents occurring on Earth. Later the D.A.T.S. is dragged into a massive conflict between Earth and the Digital World, triggered by an ambitious human scientist named Akihiro Kurata, determined to make use of the Digimon for his own personal gains. The English version was dubbed by Studiopolis and it premiered on the Jetix block on Toon Disney on October 1, 2007. Digivolution in Data Squad require the human partner DNA (\"Digital Natural Ability\" in the English version and \"Digisoul\" in the Japanese version) to activate, a strong empathy with their Digimon and a will to succeed. 'Digimon Savers also introduce a new form of digivolving called Burst Mode which essentially the level above Mega (previously the strongest form a digimon could take). Like previously in Tamers, this plot take on a dark tone throughout the story and the anime was aimed, originally in Japan, at an older audience consisting of late teens and people in their early twenties from ages 16 to 21. Because of that, along with the designs, the anime being heavily edited and localized for western US audiences like past series, and the English dub being aimed mostly toward younger audiences of children aged 6 to 10 and having a lower TV-Y7-FV rating just like past dubs, Studiopolis dubbed the anime on Jetix with far more edits, changes, censorship, and cut footage. This included giving the Japanese characters full Americanized names and American surnames as well as applying far more Americanization (Marcus Damon as opposed to the Japanese Daimon Masaru), cultural streamlining and more edit to their version similar to the changes 4Kids often made (such as removal of Japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining). Despite all that, the setting of the country was still in Japan and the characters was Japanese in the dub. This series was the first to show any Japanese cultural concepts was unfamiliar with American audiences (such as the manju), which was left unedited and used in the English dub. Also despite the heavy censorship and the English dub aimed at young children, some of the Digimon attacks named after real weapons such as RizeGreymon Trident Revolver ain't edited and used in the English dub. Well Go USA released it on DVD instead of Disney. The North American English dub was televised on Jetix in the U.S. and on the Family Channel in Canada."}]},"245":{"title":"Glacier","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What characteristics determine glacial zones?","id":"5726ffac5951b619008f844f","answers":[{"text":"surface snowpack and melt conditions","answer_start":40}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which glacial zone area report a net-loss in glacial mass?","id":"5726ffac5951b619008f8450","answers":[{"text":"ablation zone","answer_start":82}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the name of the line seperating the ablation zone from the accumulation zone?","id":"5726ffac5951b619008f8451","answers":[{"text":"equilibrium line","answer_start":152}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much glacial surface area is typically considered accumulation zone?","id":"5726ffac5951b619008f8452","answers":[{"text":"60\u201370%","answer_start":488}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"zones","answer_start":25}],"question":"What is based on suface ice and melt conditions?","id":"5a359966788daf001a5f862c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"equilibrium line","answer_start":157}],"question":"Wht line marks the center of the glacier?","id":"5a359966788daf001a5f862d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the glacier's surface area","answer_start":509}],"question":"What does the abilation zone cover 60-70% of?","id":"5a359966788daf001a5f862e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"downward force","answer_start":629}],"question":"What forces underlying rock upward?","id":"5a359966788daf001a5f862f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Great Lakes","answer_start":808}],"question":"What lakes where formed from a mountain depression","id":"5a359966788daf001a5f8630","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Glaciers are broken into zones based on surface snowpack and melt conditions.

Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian\u2013Alemannic Fastnacht. However, evidence insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begin with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and end with rebirth. Carnival reverse this as King Carnival come to life, a liminal period follow before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift eternal life in heaven and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death a necessary part of the cycle of life.

Holy Week processions in Spain include crowds vociferously insult the figure of Jesus. Irreverence, parody, degradation and laughter at a tragicomic effigy God can be seen as intensifications of the sacred order. In 1466, the Catholic Church under Pope Paul II revieved customs of the Saturnalia carnival: Jews were forced to race naked through the streets of the city of Rome. \u201cBefore they were to run, the Jews were richly fed, so as to make the race more difficult for them and at the same time more amusing for spectators.

In the UK, Nicole records, made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, was produced for a few years beginning in 1904, but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise. In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product ain't no success. Thin, flexible plastic records such as the German Phonycord and the British Filmophone and Goodson records appeared around 1930 but also did not last long. The contemporary French Path\u00e9 Cellodiscs, made of a very thin black plastic, which uncannily resemble the vinyl \"sound sheet\" magazine inserts of the 1965\u20131985 era, was similarly short-lived. In the US, Hit of the Week records, made of a patented translucent plastic called Durium coated on a heavy brown paper base, was introduced in early 1930. A new issue done came out every week and they was sold at newsstands like a weekly magazine. Although inexpensive and commercially successful at first, they soon fell victim to the Great Depression and production in the US ended in 1932. Related Durium records continued to be made somewhat later in the UK and elsewhere, and as remarkably late as 1950 in Italy, where the name \"Durium\" survived far into the LP era as a trademark on ordinary vinyl records. Despite all these attempts at innovation, shellac compounds continued to be used for the overwhelming majority of commercial 78 rpm records during the lifetime of the format."},{"qas":[{"question":"On which label Frank Sinatra release his recording of Soliloquy?","id":"57279b65ff5b5019007d90da","answers":[{"text":"Columbia Masterwork label","answer_start":1634}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was a typical recording time of a song in 1948?","id":"57279b65ff5b5019007d90db","answers":[{"text":"about 3:30","answer_start":1312}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was a way musicians got sounds such short recording times?","id":"57279b65ff5b5019007d90dc","answers":[{"text":"release a set of records","answer_start":832}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many sides of a disc commonly held a recording?","id":"57279b65ff5b5019007d90dd","answers":[{"text":"two sides","answer_start":736}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"In January 1938, Milt Gabler started recording for his new label, Commodore Records, and to allow for longer continuous performances, he recorded some 12-inch records. Eddie Condon explained: \"Gabler realized that a jam session need room for development.\" The first two 12-inch recordings did not take no advantage of the extra length: \"Carnegie Drag\" was 3:15; \"Carnegie Jump\", 2:41. But at the second session, on April 30, the two 12-inch recordings was longer: \"Embraceable You\" was 4:05; \"Serenade to a Shylock\", 4:32. Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record. Vaudeville star Gallagher and Shean recorded \"Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean\", written by Irving and Jack Kaufman, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo. An obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records. An early multi-record release was in 1903, when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera, Verdi Ernani, on 40 single-sided discs. In 1940, Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band recording of \"A Good Man Hard to Find\" in four parts, issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s. This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record, in 1948. In popular music, this time limitation of about 3:30 on a 10-inch 78 rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on no record. One exception Frank Sinatra recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein \"Soliloquy\", from Carousel, made on May 28, 1946. Because it ran 7:57, longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10-inch record, it was released on Columbia Masterwork label (the classical division) as two sides of a 12-inch record. The same was true of John Raitt performance of the song on the original cast album of Carousel, which done been issued on a 78-rpm album set by American Decca in 1945."},{"qas":[{"question":"What company out of Japan offered laser turntables read vinyl discs optically?","id":"5727cd6e2ca10214002d96c6","answers":[{"text":"ELPJ","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was a benedit of laser read discs?","id":"5727cd6e2ca10214002d96c7","answers":[{"text":"eliminate record wear","answer_start":144}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was a drawback of laser read discs?","id":"5727cd6e2ca10214002d96c8","answers":[{"text":"degrade the sound","answer_start":217}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the primary use of laser read discs?","id":"5727cd6e2ca10214002d96c9","answers":[{"text":"archiving of analog records","answer_start":284}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was a major issue for laser read discs?","id":"5727cd6e2ca10214002d96ca","answers":[{"text":"dust","answer_start":532}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"ELPJ, a Japanese-based company, sell a laser turntable use a laser to read vinyl discs optically, without physical contact.

The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describe as a \"metallic soap,\" containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut \"wax\" sound discs would be placed in a vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts was made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual \"plating\" of the mandrel occur in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, \"matrix\" or \"father.\" The \"father\" is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a \"mother\". Many mothers can be grown on a single \"father\" before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The \"mothers\" are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as \"sons\". Each \"mother\" can be used to make many \"sons\" before deteriorating. The \"sons\" are then converted into \"stampers\" by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the \"father\"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allow them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a \"son\" (for each side), the \"father\" is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the \"two-step-process\" (as it does not entail no creation of \"sons\" but involve creation of \"mothers,\" which are used for test playing and kept as \"safeties\" for electroforming future \"sons\") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl high. The \"sons\" made during a \"three-step\" electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they got a stronger metal structure than \"fathers\"."},{"qas":[{"question":"What cause clicks and pop on vinyl records?","id":"5727e4fd2ca10214002d98ea","answers":[{"text":"Dust and scratch","answer_start":165}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the cause of lock grooves on vinyl records?","id":"5727e4fd2ca10214002d98eb","answers":[{"text":"Dust and scratch","answer_start":165}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where the saying \"Like a broken record\" originate?","id":"5727e4fd2ca10214002d98ec","answers":[{"text":"locked groove","answer_start":353}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How easily vinyl records break?","id":"5727e4fd2ca10214002d98ed","answers":[{"text":"Vinyl records do not break easily","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What a common damage to vinyl records?","id":"5727e4fd2ca10214002d98ee","answers":[{"text":"easily scratched.","answer_start":60}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Vinyl records do not break easily, but the soft material is easily scratched.

The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, dey have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties was expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of 1912 and George Wallace in the election of 1968). As third party movements done learned, the Electoral College requirement of a nationally distributed majority make it difficult for third parties to succeed. Thus, such parties rarely win many electoral votes, although their popular support within a state may tip it toward one party or the other. Wallace had weak support outside the South. More generally, parties with a broad base of support across regions or among economic and other interest groups, got a great chance of winning the necessary plurality in the U.S. largely single-member district, winner-take-all elections.

When one party in a two-party system control all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant.

Other composers utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, was Claudio Monteverdi and his masterpiece, Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata (A lover tears at his beloved grave), which was composed in 1610, and Andrea Gabrieli when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style. Learning from the preceding two composeres, Heinrich Sch\u00fctz utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces in the oratorio style, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ suffering and the Passion. Five of Schutz Historien were Easter pieces, and of these the latter three, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of Matthew, Luke and John, were all done a cappella style.

Recently, as capitalism done spread throughout the world (a process called globalization), cultural studies got begun[when?] to analyze local and global forms of resistance to Western hegemony.[citation needed] Globalization in this context can be defined as western civilization in other ways, it undermine the cultural integrity of other culture and it therefore repressive, exploitative and harmful to most people in different places."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which two wrote Cultural studies [was] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition?","id":"57281099ff5b5019007d9c42","answers":[{"text":"Lindlof and Taylor","answer_start":22}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"From a Marxist view, what they believe had to be controlled  to essentially control a culture?","id":"57281099ff5b5019007d9c43","answers":[{"text":"the economic base","answer_start":1027}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Lindlof and Taylor","answer_start":22}],"question":"Which two wrote Cultural studies are grounded in a rationalist, conservative-pluralist tradition?","id":"5a39b0472f14dd001ac7258d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the economic base","answer_start":1035}],"question":"What did they believe was unnecessary to control a culture from a Marxist view?","id":"5a39b0472f14dd001ac7258e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"art historian Griselda Pollock","answer_start":1766}],"question":"Who contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of art news and philosophy?","id":"5a39b0472f14dd001ac7258f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Julia Kristeva","answer_start":1891}],"question":"Which writer contributed to cultural studies from the field of science and French modernism?","id":"5a39b0472f14dd001ac72590","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"feminist cultural studies","answer_start":1148}],"question":"What never criticized the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product?","id":"5a39b0472f14dd001ac72591","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, \"Cultural studies [was] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition\". The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and use of, mass culture; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of fandom.[citation needed] The distinction between American and British strands, however, got faded.[citation needed] Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a Marxist model to the field. This strain of thinking got some influence from the Frankfurt School, but especially from the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrate on the production of meaning. This model assume a mass production of culture and identifies power as residing with those producing cultural artifacts. In a Marxist view, those control the means of production (the economic base) essentially control a culture.[citation needed] Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view come through in the book Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman (by Paul du Gay et al.), which seek to challenge the notion that those produce commodities control the meanings people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist and art historian Griselda Pollock contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of art history and psychoanalysis. The writer Julia Kristeva is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical French feminism.[citation needed]"}]},"277":{"title":"Sahara","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What the largest hottest continuously large area   worldwide?","id":"5728c4163acd2414000dfddf","answers":[{"text":"the Great Desert","answer_start":588}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the value temperature of most of the desert?","id":"5728c4163acd2414000dfde0","answers":[{"text":"25 \u00b0C","answer_start":2570}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What percent of time the sun generally over most of the   desert?","id":"5728c4163acd2414000dfde1","answers":[{"text":"82% of the time","answer_start":185}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the annual average direct solar irradiation?","id":"5728c4163acd2414000dfde2","answers":[{"text":"around 2,800 kWh\/(m2 year)","answer_start":558}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"During daytime how high can the temperatures reach?","id":"5728c4163acd2414000dfde3","answers":[{"text":"80 \u00b0C (176 \u00b0F)","answer_start":2712}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"bright sunshine","answer_start":159}],"question":"What does the eastern desert get 3600 annual hours of?","id":"5a4c4cfc7a6c4c001a2bbbda","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"4,300 h","answer_start":411}],"question":"How much bright sunlight does lower Egypt recieve?","id":"5a4c4cfc7a6c4c001a2bbbdb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"solar energy","answer_start":656}],"question":"What type of energy production is difficult due to the heat?","id":"5a4c4cfc7a6c4c001a2bbbdc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the Great Desert","answer_start":800}],"question":"What is the second largest continuious area in the world?","id":"5a4c4cfc7a6c4c001a2bbbdd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"average high temperature","answer_start":1711}],"question":"What reaches 80 degrees F during the day?","id":"5a4c4cfc7a6c4c001a2bbbde","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"2,800 kWh\/(m2 year)","answer_start":579}],"question":"How much solar energy does the Sahara produce per year?","id":"5a60df46e9e1cc001a33cdc0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"47 \u00b0C (116.6 \u00b0F)","answer_start":1165}],"question":"What is the lowest temperature recorded in the Sahara?","id":"5a60df46e9e1cc001a33cdc1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"378 meters above sea level","answer_start":1269}],"question":"What is the elevation of the Nubian Desert?","id":"5a60df46e9e1cc001a33cdc2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"46 \u00b0C (114.8 \u00b0F)","answer_start":1597}],"question":"What is the average low temperature in Salah?","id":"5a60df46e9e1cc001a33cdc3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"13 \u00b0C (55.4 \u00b0F)","answer_start":3292}],"question":"What is the temperature of the sand during the night?","id":"5a60df46e9e1cc001a33cdc4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The sky usually clear above the desert and the sunshine duration extremely high everywhere in the Sahara. Most of the desert enjoy more than 3,600 h of bright sunshine annually or over 82% of the time and a wide area in the eastern part experiences in excess of 4,000 h of bright sunshine a year or over 91% of the time, and the highest values very close to the theoretical maximum value. A value of 4,300 h or 98% of the time would be recorded in Upper Egypt (Aswan, Luxor) and in the Nubian Desert (Wadi Halfa). The annual average direct solar irradiation around 2,800 kWh\/(m2 year) in the Great Desert. The Sahara got a huge potential for solar energy production. The constantly high position of the sun, the extremely low relative humidity, the lack of vegetation and rainfall make the Great Desert the hottest continuously large area worldwide and certainly the hottest place on Earth during summertime in some spots. The average high temperature exceed 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F) - 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) during the hottest month nearly everywhere in the desert except at very high mountainous areas. The highest officially recorded average high temperature was 47 \u00b0C (116.6 \u00b0F) in a remote desert town in the Algerian Desert called Bou Bernous with an elevation of 378 meters above sea level. It's the world highest recorded average high temperature and only Death Valley, California rival it. Other hot spots in Algeria such as Adrar, Timimoun, In Salah, Ouallene, Aoulef, Reggane with an elevation between 200 and 400 meters above sea level get slightly lower summer average highs around 46 \u00b0C (114.8 \u00b0F) during the hottest months of the year. Salah, well known in Algeria for its extreme heat, got an average high temperature of 43.8 \u00b0C (110.8 \u00b0F), 46.4 \u00b0C (115.5 \u00b0F), 45.5 (113.9 \u00b0F). Furthermore, 41.9 \u00b0C (107.4 \u00b0F) in June, July, August and September. In fact, dey is even hotter spots in the Sahara, but they are located in extremely remote areas, especially in the Azalai, lying in northern Mali. The major part of the desert experience around 3 \u2013 5 months when the average high strictly exceed 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The southern central part of the desert experience up to 6 \u2013 7 months when the average high temperature strictly exceed 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) which show the constancy and the length of the really hot season in the Sahara. Some examples of this Bilma, Niger and Faya-Largeau, Chad. The annual average daily temperature exceed 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) everywhere and can approach 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in the hottest regions year-round. However, most of the desert got a value in excess of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). The sand and ground temperatures even more extreme. During daytime, the sand temperature extremely high as it can easily reach 80 \u00b0C (176 \u00b0F) or more. A sand temperature of 83.5 \u00b0C (182.3 \u00b0F) done been recorded in Port Sudan. Ground temperatures of 72 \u00b0C (161.6 \u00b0F) done been recorded in the Adrar of Mauritania and a value of 75 \u00b0C (167 \u00b0F) done been measured in Borkou, northern Chad. Due to lack of cloud cover and very low humidity, the desert usually feature high diurnal temperature variations between days and nights. However, it's a myth that the nights cold after extremely hot days in the Sahara. The average diurnal temperature range typically between 13 \u00b0C (55.4 \u00b0F) and 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F). The lowest values are found along the coastal regions due to high humidity and often even lower than 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F), while the highest values are found in inland desert areas where the humidity the lowest, mainly in the southern Sahara. Still, it's true that winter nights can be cold as it can drop to the freezing point and even below, especially in high-elevation areas."},{"qas":[{"question":"What the reason the northern fringe receive more   cloudiness and rainfall?","id":"5728c4ee3acd2414000dfdfb","answers":[{"text":"low pressure systems","answer_start":266}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the average rainfall of the Sahara?","id":"5728c4ee3acd2414000dfdfc","answers":[{"text":"less than 1 mm","answer_start":1150}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much desert land the Sahara?","id":"5728c4ee3acd2414000dfdfd","answers":[{"text":"9,000,000 km2 of desert land","answer_start":1246}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What cause the southern fringe to receive cloudiness and   rainfall?","id":"5728c4ee3acd2414000dfdfe","answers":[{"text":"Intertropical Convergence Zone","answer_start":695}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"annual rainfall","answer_start":12}],"question":"what is nearly non existent across the Sahara?","id":"5a4c50d07a6c4c001a2bbbe4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"low pressure systems over the Mediterranean Sea along the polar front","answer_start":268}],"question":"What contributes to the north's cloudiness and moderate rainfall??","id":"5a4c50d07a6c4c001a2bbbe5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"southern fringe of the desert","answer_start":571}],"question":"What area is cloudy and dry in the summer?","id":"5a4c50d07a6c4c001a2bbbe6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the Sahara","answer_start":1199}],"question":"What has a land area of 9,000,000 sq mi?","id":"5a4c50d07a6c4c001a2bbbe7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The thin northern fringe","answer_start":162}],"question":"What area receives the least amount of winter cloudiness?","id":"5a610113e9e1cc001a33ce2e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The vast central hyper-arid core","answer_start":897}],"question":"What is drastically affected by northerly or southerly atmospheric disturbances?","id":"5a610113e9e1cc001a33ce2f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"31%","answer_start":1335}],"question":"What percentage of Niger receives and annual rainfall above 10mm?","id":"5a610113e9e1cc001a33ce30","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"17%","answer_start":1461}],"question":"What percentage of Dakhla has an annual rainfall of 5mm or less?","id":"5a610113e9e1cc001a33ce31","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"nearly non-existent","answer_start":103}],"question":"What is rainfall like in the western fringes of the desert?","id":"5a610113e9e1cc001a33ce32","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The average annual rainfall range from very low in the northern and southern fringes of the desert to nearly non-existent over the central and the eastern part.

For example, Biskra, Algeria and Ouarzazate, Morocco are found in this zone. The southern fringe of the desert along the border with the Sahel receive summer cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of the Intertropical Convergence Zone from the south and the annual average rainfall range from 100 mm (3,93 in) to 250 mm (9,84 in). For example, Timbuktu, Mali and Agadez, Niger are found in this zone. The vast central hyper-arid core of the desert is virtually never affected by northerly or southerly atmospheric disturbances and permanently remain under the influence of the strongest anticyclonic weather regime and the annual average rainfall can drop to less than 1 mm (0.04 in). In fact, most of the Sahara receive less than 20 mm (0.79 in). Of the 9,000,000 km2 of desert land in the Sahara, an area of about 2,800,000 km2 (about 31% of the total area) receive an annual average rainfall amount of 10 mm (0.39 in) or less, while some 1,500,000 km2 (about 17% of the total area) receive an average of 5 mm or less.

The rainfall very unreliable and erratic in the Sahara as it may vary considerably year by year. In full contrast to the negligible annual rainfall amounts, the annual rates of potential evaporation extraordinarily high, roughly ranging from 2,500 mm\/year to more than 6,000 mm\/year in the whole desert. don't nowhere else on Earth done air been found as dry and evaporative as in the Sahara region.

Many subatomic particles exist for only a fixed fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but some travel close to the speed of light can be measured to travel farther and survive much longer than expected (a muon one example).

Examples of this include the Second law of thermodynamics, which state that entropy must increase over time (see Entropy); the cosmological arrow of time, which point away from the Big Bang, CPT symmetry, and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only traveling forwards in time (see light cone).

This latter property can be illustrated by a simple example. Suppose we are dealing with particles (such as electrons) of semi-integral spin (angular momentum) for which dey is only two possible values: positive or negative. Then, a principle of indetermination establish the spin, relative to two different directions (e.g., x and y) results in a pair of incompatible quantities. Suppose that the state \u0278 of a certain electron verifies the proposition \"the spin of the electron in the x direction is positive.\" By the principle of indeterminacy, the value of the spin in the direction y gon be completely indeterminate for \u0278. Hence, \u0278 can verify neither the proposition \"the spin in the direction of y is positive\" nor the proposition \"the spin in the direction of y negative.\" Nevertheless, the disjunction of the propositions \"the spin in the direction of y is positive or the spin in the direction of y negative\" must be true for \u0278.

The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield (and introduced by Vivian Stanshall) on Oldfield album Tubular Bells, as well as on a number of his subsequent albums (particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge (1974) and Ommadawn (1975)). It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne, featured two members on the instrument, Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe, and whose \"Fog on the Tyne\" was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972. The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs. Maggie May by Rod Stewart, which hit No. 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100, also featured Jackson playing. It done also been used by other British rock musicians. Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones an accomplished mandolin player and done recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That's the Way; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page, composed the song. Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do, and Black Country Woman.

Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull a highly accomplished mandolin player (beautiful track Pussy Willow), as is his guitarist Martin Barre. The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr. More recently, the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin, played by Ailidh Lennon, on tracks such as Fight, Start to End, and Medicine. British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs. Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London Indigo Moss use it throughout their recordings and live gigs.

A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represent the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This mean that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups.

During the sixties both books was published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet\u2014 which was true, but ain't no proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babi\u0107 further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic was written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967.

If one (unrealistically) assume that dey is no friction or other losses, the conversion of energy between these processes would be perfect, and the pendulum would continue swinging forever."},{"qas":[{"question":"What show that the conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of translational symmetry of time?","id":"572a0071af94a219006aa749","answers":[{"text":"Noether theorem","answer_start":68}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the quantity which canonical conjugate to time?","id":"572a0071af94a219006aa74a","answers":[{"text":"energy","answer_start":105}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"This mathematical entanglement of energy and time results in what?","id":"572a0071af94a219006aa74b","answers":[{"text":"the uncertainty principle","answer_start":505}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What state it impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval?","id":"572a0071af94a219006aa74c","answers":[{"text":"uncertainty principle","answer_start":509}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Noether's theorem","answer_start":71}],"question":"What shows that the conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of translational asymmetry of time?","id":"5acd5c0607355d001abf3ebe","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"energy","answer_start":403}],"question":"What is the quality which is canonical conjugate to time?","id":"5acd5c0607355d001abf3ebf","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the uncertainty principle","answer_start":530}],"question":"This mathematical entanglement of energy and space results in what?","id":"5acd5c0607355d001abf3ec0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"uncertainty principle","answer_start":534}],"question":"What states it is possible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval?","id":"5acd5c0607355d001abf3ec1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"energy conservation","answer_start":701}],"question":"what should be confused with the uncertainty principle?","id":"5acd5c0607355d001abf3ec2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"This law a fundamental principle of physics.

In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would ain't what it is. For example, an apple an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes.

This miss some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \"reality\" go beyond mere \"possibilities of sensation\", such a position lead to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill formulation leave open the unsettling possibility that the \"gap-filling entities purely possibilities and not actualities at all\". Thirdly, Mill position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fail to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction."},{"qas":[{"question":"What phase of empiricism ended in the 1940s?","id":"572b40d0111d821400f38df6","answers":[{"text":"phenomenalist","answer_start":4}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How can't a finite set of statements be described?","id":"572b40d0111d821400f38df7","answers":[{"text":"in purely sensory terms","answer_start":731}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What necessary to explain a doctor normality in sensory terms?","id":"572b40d0111d821400f38df8","answers":[{"text":"a second doctor","answer_start":1191}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1940s","answer_start":63}],"question":"When did the phenomenalist phase begin?","id":"5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1940s","answer_start":63}],"question":"When was the problem of the third man published?","id":"5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"purely sensory terms","answer_start":739}],"question":"How must a finite set of statements be described?","id":"5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"we must refer to a third doctor","answer_start":1502}],"question":"How many doctors do you need to satisfy the hypothetical problem?","id":"5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the former must be at least deducible from the latter","answer_start":307}],"question":"How did it become possible for physical object statements to translate into sense-data statements?","id":"5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfe","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it done become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into no statements about actual and possible sense data.

These lateral lines are called \"yard lines\" and often marked with the distance in yards from and an arrow pointed toward the nearest goal line. In previous decades, arrows was not used and every yard line was usually marked with the distance to the goal line, including the goal line itself which was marked with a \"0\"; in most stadiums today, the 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-yard lines are marked with numbers, with the goal line sometimes being marked with a \"G\". The centre (55-yard) line usually is marked with a \"C\". \"Hash marks\" are painted in white, parallel to the yardage lines, at 1 yard (0.9 m) intervals, 24 yards (21.9 m) from the sidelines. On fields got a surrounding running track, such as Commonwealth Stadium, Molson Stadium, and many universities, the end zones are often cut off in the corners to accommodate the track. In 2014, Edmonton placed turf over the track to create full end zones. This was particularly common among U.S.-based teams during the CFL American expansion, where few American stadiums was able to accommodate the much longer and noticeably wider CFL field."},{"qas":[{"question":"What the term for play stopped because the ball carrier, although not fully tackled, can no longer advance the ball?","id":"572e8686c246551400ce42c2","answers":[{"text":"forward progress","answer_start":446}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where the next play start unless a team done just scored?","id":"572e8686c246551400ce42c3","answers":[{"text":"scrimmage","answer_start":189}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which parts of the ball carrier body do not cause no play to stop when they touch the ground?","id":"572e8686c246551400ce42c4","answers":[{"text":"feet and hands","answer_start":83}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which direction of pass causes play to stop when it ain't caught?","id":"572e8686c246551400ce42c5","answers":[{"text":"forward","answer_start":142}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the next play","answer_start":500}],"question":"If a player's knee is forced to the ground, what starts from scrimmage?","id":"5a0f5627decec90018475575","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"feet and hands","answer_start":86}],"question":"What parts of the ball carriers forward progress won't stop play when touching the ground?","id":"5a0f5627decec90018475576","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"forwards","answer_start":437}],"question":"Which touchdown causes play to stop when not caught?","id":"5a0f5627decec90018475577","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"scrimmage","answer_start":526}],"question":"Where does the next field goal start unless a team has scored?","id":"5a0f5627decec90018475578","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"forward progress","answer_start":454}],"question":"What means play stopped because the ball carrier can move forward?","id":"5a0f5627decec90018475579","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Play stop when the ball carrier knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a tackle); when a forward pass ain't caught on no fly (during no scrimmage); when a touchdown (see below) or a field goal is scored; when the ball leave the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier in a standing position but can no longer move forwards (called forward progress).

Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks was just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it was interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks was real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number solve the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death."},{"qas":[{"question":"Feyman experience on the Rogers Commission was talked about is which of his books?","id":"572e8f2edfa6aa1500f8d133","answers":[{"text":"What You Care What Other People Think?","answer_start":44}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which way he write about his experience on the Rogers Commission?","id":"572e8f2edfa6aa1500f8d134","answers":[{"text":"sober narrative","answer_start":223}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"His writings about the Rogers Commission showed that trouble was brewing between scientists and executives at which prolific institute?","id":"572e8f2edfa6aa1500f8d135","answers":[{"text":"NASA","answer_start":284}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"While the higher-ups said a failure was unlikely, at 1 in 100,000 odds, the scientists felt the odd was what?","id":"572e8f2edfa6aa1500f8d136","answers":[{"text":"1 in 200","answer_start":675}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who NASA recruit by using flawed safety numbers?","id":"572e8f2edfa6aa1500f8d137","answers":[{"text":"Christa McAuliffe","answer_start":864}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"What Do You Care What Other People Think?","answer_start":44}],"question":"What book ignored Feynman's experience on the Rogers Commission?","id":"5a8dde3adf8bba001a0f9ccb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"sober narrative","answer_start":226}],"question":"Which way did he avoid writing about his experience on the Rogers Commission?","id":"5a8dde3adf8bba001a0f9ccc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"NASA managers","answer_start":489}],"question":"What managers claimed there was a 1 in 10,000 chance of catastrophic failure aboard the shuttle?","id":"5a8dde3adf8bba001a0f9ccd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Christa McAuliffe","answer_start":883}],"question":"Who did NASA recruit while using accurate safety numbers?","id":"5a8dde3adf8bba001a0f9cce","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Feynman","answer_start":0}],"question":"Who concluded that NASA management was fantastically realistic?","id":"5a8dde3adf8bba001a0f9ccf","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Feynman devoted the latter half of his book What You Care What Other People Think? to his experience on the Rogers Commission, straying from his usual convention of brief, light-hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative.

The notable absence of Elliott father in E.T., the most famous example of this theme. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, it is revealed that Indy done always had a very strained relationship with his father, a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father do not seem to realize or understand the negative effect his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believe he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son \"self reliance,\" which ain't how Indy saw it).

Munich depict Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. dey is of course exceptions; Brody in Jaws is a committed family man, while John Anderton in Minority Report a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (protagonist Elliot mother is divorced) and Catch Me If You Can (Frank Abagnale mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in Jurassic Park (early in the film, another secondary character mention Tim and Lex parents divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim look to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim.

Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these was minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related \u2014 for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors. In fact, prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant \u2014 the elevator operator. However, dey was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes was engaged. This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables was connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era done been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, dey is a device which detect whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happen, the device cause copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis. In addition, a oil\/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil\/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) somewhat cushion any impact. However, In Thailand, in November 2012, a woman was killed in free falling elevator, in what was reported as the \"first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift\"."},{"qas":[{"question":"Underground electrolytic malfunctions in hydraulic elevators can result in the destruction of what?","id":"572eddd7dfa6aa1500f8d47f","answers":[{"text":"the cylinder and bulkhead","answer_start":87}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What Elevator Safety Code change required a second dished bulkhead?","id":"572eddd7dfa6aa1500f8d480","answers":[{"text":"1972 ASME A17.1","answer_start":205}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Before the code change was enacted what was the only permitted hydraulic cylinder type?","id":"572eddd7dfa6aa1500f8d481","answers":[{"text":"single-bottom","answer_start":366}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Once the cylinder is breached, what calamity do the loss of fluid cause?","id":"572eddd7dfa6aa1500f8d482","answers":[{"text":"uncontrolled down movement of the elevator","answer_start":462}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What testing the code require?","id":"572eddd7dfa6aa1500f8d483","answers":[{"text":"periodic testing of the pressure capability","answer_start":778}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Past problems with hydraulic elevators include underground electrolytic destruction of the cylinder and bulkhead, pipe failures, and control failures. Single bulkhead cylinders, typically built prior to a 1972 ASME A17.1 Elevator Safety Code change requiring a second dished bulkhead, was subject to possible catastrophic failure. The code previously permitted only single-bottom hydraulic cylinders. In the event of a cylinder breach, the fluid loss results in uncontrolled down movement of the elevator. This create two significant hazards: being subject to an impact at the bottom when the elevator stop suddenly and being in the entrance for a potential shear if the rider is partly in the elevator. Because it impossible to verify the system at all times, the code require periodic testing of the pressure capability. Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a plunger gripping device. One commercially available is known by the marketing name \"LifeJacket\". This a device which, in the event of an uncontrolled downward acceleration, nondestructively grip the plunger and stop the car. A device known as an overspeed or rupture valve is attached to the hydraulic inlet\/outlet of the cylinder and is adjusted for a maximum flow rate. If a pipe or hose was to break (rupture), the flow rate of the rupture valve gon surpass a set limit and mechanically stop the outlet flow of hydraulic fluid, thus stopping the plunger and the car in the down direction."},{"qas":[{"question":"What the main function of direction lanterns?","id":"572f010ddfa6aa1500f8d551","answers":[{"text":"to help people decide whether or not to get on no elevator","answer_start":153}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What might change your mind about whether or not to enter no elevator","id":"572f010ddfa6aa1500f8d552","answers":[{"text":"If somebody waiting for the elevator want to go up, but a car come first indicate that it is going down","answer_start":213}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of etching might you see on a direction indicator?","id":"572f010ddfa6aa1500f8d553","answers":[{"text":"arrows or shaped like arrows","answer_start":473}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Some elevators may use the color convention for only what purpose?","id":"572f010ddfa6aa1500f8d554","answers":[{"text":"to differentiate between directions","answer_start":818}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Direction lanterns are also found both inside and outside elevator cars, but they should always be visible from outside because their primary purpose is to help people decide whether or not to get on no elevator.

This scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments ain't electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains predated London underground railways, was not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solve the problem. Although the supply got an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensure that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this ain't possible for running rails which gotta be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should dey be a leakage through the running rails."}]},"355":{"title":"Spanish_language_in_the_United_States","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"When the Venezuelans emigrate to the united states?","id":"572eb7eddfa6aa1500f8d309","answers":[{"text":"Until the 20th century, dey was no clear record of the number of Venezuelans emigrated to the United States.","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Venezuela have immigrates from other countries?","id":"572eb7eddfa6aa1500f8d30a","answers":[{"text":"Between the 18th and early 19th centuries, dey was many European immigrants went to Venezuela","answer_start":109}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Why Venezuelans come to America?","id":"572eb7eddfa6aa1500f8d30b","answers":[{"text":"Many Venezuelans settled in the United States with hopes of receiving a better education, only to remain in there following graduation.","answer_start":522}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Venezuelans still come to America for the same reasons as they did before?","id":"572eb7eddfa6aa1500f8d30c","answers":[{"text":"since the early 1980s, the reasons for Venezuelan emigration done changed to include hopes of earning a higher salary","answer_start":708}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the 20th century","answer_start":6}],"question":"When did the Venezuelans emmigrate to Mexico?","id":"5a773af22d6d7f001a4a9f63","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"with hopes of receiving a better education","answer_start":583}],"question":"Why did Europeans come to America?","id":"5a773af22d6d7f001a4a9f64","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"early 1980s","answer_start":733}],"question":"Since when has European immigration included hopes of a higher salary?","id":"5a773af22d6d7f001a4a9f65","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"over 4,000","answer_start":399}],"question":"How many South Americans emigrated to Mexico from 1910 to 1930?","id":"5a773af22d6d7f001a4a9f66","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Between the 18th and early 19th centuries","answer_start":115}],"question":"When did Europenan immigrants go to Venezuela and later to Mexico?","id":"5a773af22d6d7f001a4a9f67","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Until the 20th century, dey was no clear record of the number of Venezuelans emigrated to the United States.

But as the antenna height is increased, the reduced power of the reflected wave (due to the inverse square law) allow the antenna to approach its asymptotic feedpoint impedance given by theory. At lower heights, the effect on the antenna impedance very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground, as this affect the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in the antenna. Changing the antenna height by a quarter wavelength, then change the phase of the reflection by 180\u00b0, with a completely different effect on the antenna impedance."}]},"368":{"title":"Flowering_plant","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What process double fertilization refer to?","id":"572f50f8b2c2fd140056800b","answers":[{"text":"two sperm cells fertilize cells in the ovary","answer_start":49}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What a pollen grain adhere to, to start the process of double fertilization?","id":"572f50f8b2c2fd140056800c","answers":[{"text":"the stigma of the pistil","answer_start":144}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of cell travel down the pollen tube while it's growing?","id":"572f50f8b2c2fd140056800d","answers":[{"text":"haploid generative","answer_start":280}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where the pollen tube release its sperm cells?","id":"572f50f8b2c2fd140056800e","answers":[{"text":"one of the synergids","answer_start":599}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What serve as the embryo food supply?","id":"572f50f8b2c2fd140056800f","answers":[{"text":"endosperm","answer_start":983}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Double fertilization","answer_start":0}],"question":"When a pollen tube fertilizes cells in the ovary, what is it called?","id":"5a3b08053ff257001ab843a5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"when a pollen grain adheres to the stigma of the pistil (female reproductive structure), germinates, and grows a long pollen tube","answer_start":116}],"question":"What begins the process of synergid?","id":"5a3b08053ff257001ab843a6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the stigma of the pistil","answer_start":147}],"question":"What does a sperm cell adhere to to start double fertilization?","id":"5a3b08053ff257001ab843a7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The synergid","answer_start":688}],"question":"What degenerates as a pollen grain adheres to the stigma?","id":"5a3b08053ff257001ab843a8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"both central cell nuclei","answer_start":868}],"question":"What does the zygote fuse with to produce a triploid?","id":"5a3b08053ff257001ab843a9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Double fertilization refer to a process in which two sperm cells fertilize cells in the ovary. This process begin when a pollen grain adhere to the stigma of the pistil (female reproductive structure), germinates, and grow a long pollen tube. While this pollen tube is growing, a haploid generative cell travel down the tube behind the tube nucleus. The generative cell divide by mitosis to produce two haploid (n) sperm cells. As the pollen tube grow, it make its way from the stigma, down the style and into the ovary. Here the pollen tube reach the micropyle of the ovule and digest its way into one of the synergids, releasing its contents (which include the sperm cells). The synergid the cells was released into degenerates and one sperm make its way to fertilize the egg cell, producing a diploid (2n) zygote. The second sperm cell fuses with both central cell nuclei, producing a triploid (3n) cell. As the zygote develops into an embryo, the triploid cell develops into the endosperm, which serves as the embryo food supply.

However, like infants (Latin infans meaning \"unable to speak\"), animals cannot answer no questions about whether they feel pain; thus the defining criterion for pain in humans cannot be applied to them. Philosophers and scientists done responded to this difficulty in a variety of ways. Ren\u00e9 Descartes for example argued that animals lack consciousness and therefore do not experience no pain and suffering in no way humans do. Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals, write that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain. In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to \"prove\" that animals are conscious, and to provide \"scientifically acceptable\" grounds for claiming that they feel pain.

Bacteria was also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes. Here, eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells, which was themselves possibly related to the Archaea. This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alphaproteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes, which are still found in all known Eukarya (sometimes in highly reduced form, e.g. in ancient \"amitochondrial\" protozoa).

In its early history, as Rome successfully defended itself against foreign threats in central and then northern Italy, neighboring city-states sought the protection a Roman alliance would bring. As such, early republican Rome ain't \"no empire\" or \"state\" in the modern sense, but an alliance of independent city-states (similar to the Greek hegemonies of the same period) with varying degrees of genuine independence (which itself changed over time) engaged in an alliance of mutual self-protection, but led by Rome. With some important exceptions, successful wars in early republican Rome generally led not to annexation or military occupation, but to the restoration of the way things was. But the defeated city would be weakened (sometimes with outright land concessions) and thus less able to resist Romanizing influences, such as Roman settlers seeking land or trade with the growing Roman confederacy. It was also less able to defend itself against its non-Roman enemies, which made attack by these enemies more likely.

During this time, many of the newest American-trained Chinese units and supplies was forcibly locked in the Burmese theater under Joseph Stilwell set by terms of the Lend-Lease Agreement. Though Japan suffered about 100,000 casualties, these attacks, the biggest in several years, gained much ground for Japan before Chinese forces stopped the incursions in Guangxi. Despite major tactical victories, the operation overall failed to provide Japan with any significant strategic gains. A great majority of the Chinese forces was able to retreat out of the area, and later come back to attack Japanese positions such as Battle of West Hunan. Japan ain't any closer in defeating China after this operation, and the constant defeat the Japanese suffered in the Pacific meant that Japan never got no time and resources needed to achieve final victory over China.

However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch most common. Natural forests in Ireland mainly oak, ash, wych elm, birch and pine. Beech and lime, though not native to Ireland, also common there. Farmland host a variety of semi-natural vegetation of grasses and flowering plants. Woods, hedgerows, mountain slopes and marshes host heather, wild grasses, gorse and bracken."},{"qas":[{"question":"The United Kingdom part of what union?","id":"5730376e04bcaa1900d77397","answers":[{"text":"European Union (EU)","answer_start":48}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the Schengen area allow in the European Union?","id":"5730376e04bcaa1900d77398","answers":[{"text":"passport-free travel between EU members state","answer_start":291}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was a free-travel area created betwen Northern Ireland and Ireland?","id":"5730376e04bcaa1900d77399","answers":[{"text":"1997","answer_start":444}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"This free-travel area in Ireland is now called what?","id":"5730376e04bcaa1900d7739a","answers":[{"text":"Common Travel Area","answer_start":593}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"European Union","answer_start":52}],"question":"Ireland and the Crown Dependencies are part of what union?","id":"5acda1b107355d001abf4884","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"passport-free travel between EU members states.","answer_start":307}],"question":"What type of travel does the Amsterdam Treaty area allow?","id":"5acda1b107355d001abf4885","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Schengen area","answer_start":281}],"question":"Both the United Kingdom and Ireland are part of what area?","id":"5acda1b107355d001abf4886","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the partition of Ireland","answer_start":370}],"question":"A formal free-travel area has existed across the region since when?","id":"5acda1b107355d001abf4887","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the Common Travel Area.","answer_start":604}],"question":"Since 1997 the area has required informal recognition and has become known as what?","id":"5acda1b107355d001abf4888","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Ireland and the United Kingdom both part of the European Union (EU).

The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of specialised roles done evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spend most time. For example, dey is central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determine the style of the team play; more forwards and fewer defenders create a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse create a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, dey is few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team players is known as a formation.

Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping \"wasn't very obvious\" due to no lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by video no tutorial added on the RTM release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides). Despite this \"stumbling block\", Bright said that Windows 8 interface wrought well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \"Metro\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \"as stunning as it surprising\", contributing to an \"incredibly personal\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \"clumsy and impractical\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\"), and concluded that \"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction\u2014touch and tablets -- allow it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple iPad.\""},{"qas":[{"question":"What CCTV stand for?","id":"573056f1069b531400832085","answers":[{"text":"China Central Television","answer_start":32}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the name of the Chinese social network?","id":"573056f1069b531400832086","answers":[{"text":"Sina Weibo","answer_start":865}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who claimed that the Window 8 OS could gather sensitive user information?","id":"573056f1069b531400832087","answers":[{"text":"Ni Guangnan","answer_start":191}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where Yang Min practice as a computer scientiest?","id":"573056f1069b531400832088","answers":[{"text":"Fudan University","answer_start":549}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"China Central Television","answer_start":32}],"question":"What doesn't CCTV stand for?","id":"5ad4a204ba00c4001a268e88","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"China Central Television","answer_start":32}],"question":"What does CTCV stand for?","id":"5ad4a204ba00c4001a268e89","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Sina Weibo","answer_start":875}],"question":"What isn't the name of the Chinese social network?","id":"5ad4a204ba00c4001a268e8a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Ni Guangnan","answer_start":191}],"question":"Who claimed that the Window 9 OS could gather sensitive user information?","id":"5ad4a204ba00c4001a268e8b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Fudan University","answer_start":557}],"question":"Where didn't Yang Min practice as a computer scientest?","id":"5ad4a204ba00c4001a268e8c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In June 2014, state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) broadcast a news story further characterizing Windows 8 as a threat to national security.

Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory doctrines surrounding Mary purification was likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen title of Mary at the Annunciation as \"prepurified\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, gon be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \"Conception of St. Ann [i.e., of the Theotokos in her womb]\" was becoming popular. After this period, the \"purification\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius)."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where the majority of the concepts of Mary birth show themselves the most ?","id":"5730ca8fb7151e1900c01536","answers":[{"text":"Mary Immaculate Conception appear only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians","answer_start":25}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What Byzantine Ruler ho ruled from from 527 to 565 was also a well trained thinker of concepts ?","id":"5730ca8fb7151e1900c01537","answers":[{"text":"Emperor Justinian I,","answer_start":300}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In what way this Ruler refer to Mary  in his writings ?","id":"5730ca8fb7151e1900c01538","answers":[{"text":"to call Mary  done\"prepurified\"","answer_start":336}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What event happened to Theotokos was of significant religious note ?","id":"5730ca8fb7151e1900c01539","answers":[{"text":"she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation","answer_start":607}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How some view the the person whose name include a Christian rite of passage from the Bible?","id":"5730ca8fb7151e1900c0153a","answers":[{"text":"holier than all 'Men' born of woman","answer_start":709}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Mary's Immaculate Conception","answer_start":25}],"question":"What doctrine appeared first among the Latin theologies?","id":"5a27289cc93d92001a4003ff","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Sophronius'","answer_start":857}],"question":"Whose teachings did Emperor Justinian I augment?","id":"5a27289cc93d92001a400400","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Sophronius","answer_start":537}],"question":"Who says that Mary was not immaculate at the Annunciation?","id":"5a27289cc93d92001a400401","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"St. John Damascene","answer_start":911}],"question":"Who said that Mary had the honor of being the first to purify the waters of baptism by touching them?","id":"5a27289cc93d92001a400402","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Damascene's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa","answer_start":1477}],"question":"What uses Mary's absolute holiness is a key for understanding her pre-purification?","id":"5a27289cc93d92001a400403","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Although the doctrine of Mary Immaculate Conception appear only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, was accustomed to call Mary  done\"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos done was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749\/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ, especially in the legacy of Nazianzen. As such, Nazianzen assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary holiness to also imitate Christ baptism at the Jordan. The Damascene hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary \"pre purification\" as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature. In fact, Damascene (along with Nazianzen) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary complete holiness from her Conception by the \"all pure seed\" of Joachim and the womb \"wider than heaven\" of St. Ann."},{"qas":[{"question":"Who began to query the position of the conception of Mary following the 11th century ?","id":"5730ef4105b4da19006bcc60","answers":[{"text":"St Bernard of Clairvaux","answer_start":21}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who the query starter lay blame upon for the festivals surrounded Mary inception ?","id":"5730ef4205b4da19006bcc61","answers":[{"text":"St Bernard blame the canons of the metropolitan church of Lyon for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See.","answer_start":242}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the query starter believe to be the ultimate difficulty in accepting  the a virgin conception of Mary ?","id":"5730ef4205b4da19006bcc62","answers":[{"text":"How can dey be absence of sin where dey is concupiscence (libido)?","answer_start":750}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the query starter believe been done by Mary direct  maternal line contradict the conception theory of immaculate for Mary ?","id":"5730ef4205b4da19006bcc63","answers":[{"text":"conception in the active sense of the mother cooperation","answer_start":663}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The query starter believe that the festival for Mary conception had authorization to be held ?","id":"5730ef4205b4da19006bcc64","answers":[{"text":"instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See","answer_start":309}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"St Bernard of Clairvaux","answer_start":22}],"question":"Who raised the question of the Immaculate Conception in the 1200s?","id":"5a273563c93d92001a400425","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin","answer_start":133}],"question":"What was already being celebrated in some churches of the East?","id":"5a273563c93d92001a400426","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"church of Lyon","answer_start":295}],"question":"Who instituted a feast of the conception of the Blessed Virgin with the permission of the Holy See?","id":"5a273563c93d92001a400427","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Mary","answer_start":469}],"question":"Whose conception does St. Bernard say was sinless?","id":"5a273563c93d92001a400428","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Pope Pius IX","answer_start":614}],"question":"What Pope's definition of conception agreed with St. Bernard's?","id":"5a273563c93d92001a400429","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"It seem to have been St Bernard of Clairvaux  in the 12th century, explicitly raised the question of the Immaculate Conception.

Some critical disease characteristics should be evaluated include virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness. The human strains of Ebola virus, for example, incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after. As no result, the victims of this disease do not have no opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone. Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial stage of Ebola ain't very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging. As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola very rapid and usually stay within a relatively confined geographical area. In contrast, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) kill its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system. As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease. Also, the relatively low virulence allow its victims to travel long distances, increasing the likelihood of an epidemic."}]},"438":{"title":"Hunting","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kind of occupation Hindu scriptures describe hunting as being?","id":"57344a29879d6814001ca4a1","answers":[{"text":"acceptable","answer_start":40}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What one of the names of the god Shiva?","id":"57344a29879d6814001ca4a2","answers":[{"text":"Mrigavyadha","answer_start":206}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the translation of Mrigavyadha?","id":"57344a29879d6814001ca4a3","answers":[{"text":"\"the deer hunter\"","answer_start":238}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What Shiva destroy in human beings?","id":"57344a29879d6814001ca4a4","answers":[{"text":"animal instincts","answer_start":406}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What talent Dasharatha have?","id":"57344a29879d6814001ca4a5","answers":[{"text":"hunt in the dark","answer_start":603}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What scriptures describe hunting as and acceptable occupation?","id":"5735f8bc012e2f140011a106","answers":[{"text":"Hindu","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Godly figures done engaged in what activity?","id":"5735f8bc012e2f140011a107","answers":[{"text":"hunting","answer_start":26}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Mrigavyadha mean what?","id":"5735f8bc012e2f140011a108","answers":[{"text":"deer hunter","answer_start":243}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Mrigavyadha destroy animal instinct in who?","id":"5735f8bc012e2f140011a109","answers":[{"text":"human beings","answer_start":504}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happened after Krishna was accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter?","id":"5735f8bc012e2f140011a10a","answers":[{"text":"died","answer_start":1075}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"by an arrow of a hunter","answer_start":1127}],"question":"How was Shiva accidentally wounded to later die?","id":"5ace5cb432bba1001ae4a3f9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"animal instincts","answer_start":496}],"question":"What does Ramayana destroy in animals?","id":"5ace5cb432bba1001ae4a3fa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"in the dark","answer_start":620}],"question":"How is Krishna said to be able to hunt?","id":"5ace5cb432bba1001ae4a3fb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Shravana","answer_start":695}],"question":"Who did Krishna mistake for game and accidentally kill?","id":"5ace5cb432bba1001ae4a3fc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the forest","answer_start":752}],"question":"Where was Krishna exiled to?","id":"5ace5cb432bba1001ae4a3fd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation, as well as a sport of the kingly.

Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided by the use of hounds, with the illegal use of trap guns, trap cages and snare nets. With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), dey is some concern that the practice might ain't sustainable. In addition dey is at present no bag limits and the open season comparatively very long (5 months - October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters very high. Added to that, dey is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species (red-rumped agouti, lowland paca, nine-banded armadillo, collared peccary, and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013). It appear that the red brocket deer population done been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the green iguana, the gold tegu, the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached. dey is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys, southern tamanduas, Brazilian porcupines, yellow-footed tortoises, Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds, the scarlet ibis. Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training. dey is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authority under-staffed and under-funded, and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting occurring both in and out of season, and even in wildlife sanctuaries. dey is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation gon be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments, and if the general populace gon move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management."}]},"439":{"title":"Kathmandu","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"When was the Pashupatinath Temple built?","id":"5735bb89e853931400426af7","answers":[{"text":"5th century","answer_start":34}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What faith the Pashupatinath Temple serve?","id":"5735bb89e853931400426af8","answers":[{"text":"Hindu","answer_start":46}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What another name for Pashupati?","id":"5735bb89e853931400426af9","answers":[{"text":"Lord Shiva","answer_start":72}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Prior to the secularization of Nepal, was the country national god?","id":"5735bb89e853931400426afa","answers":[{"text":"Lord Pashupatinath","answer_start":277}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who damaged the Pashupatinath Temple in the 14th century?","id":"5735bb89e853931400426afb","answers":[{"text":"Mughal invaders","answer_start":385}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"The Pashupatinath Temple a famous 5th century Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva (Pashupati).

(Higher generations particles quickly decay into first-generation particles, and thus ain't commonly encountered.)"},{"qas":[{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Matter","answer_start":303}],"question":"What exists independently?","id":"5a7de83a70df9f001a8752eb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Aristotle","answer_start":611}],"question":"Who said matter had actuality in and of itself?","id":"5a7de83a70df9f001a8752ec","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a whole","answer_start":785}],"question":"Aristotle said parts have existence outside of what?","id":"5a7de83a70df9f001a8752ed","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"itself","answer_start":66}],"question":"What does grass turn the horse into?","id":"5a7de83a70df9f001a8752ee","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"For example, a horse eat grass: the horse change the grass into itself; the grass as such do not persist in no horse, but some aspect of it\u2014its matter\u2014do. The matter ain't specifically described (e.g., as no atoms), but consist of whatever persist in the change of substance from grass to horse. Matter in this understanding do not exist independently (i.e., as no substance), but exist interdependently (i.e., as a \"principle\") with form and only insofar as it underlie change. It can be helpful to conceive of the relationship of matter and form as very similar to that between parts and whole. For Aristotle, matter as such can only receive actuality from form; it got no activity or actuality in itself, similar to the way parts as such only got their existence in a whole (otherwise they would be independent wholes)."},{"qas":[{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"four","answer_start":42}],"question":"How many quarks and leptons are there?","id":"5a7e05ef70df9f001a875425","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Standard Model","answer_start":138}],"question":"What model satisfactorily explains gravity?","id":"5a7e05ef70df9f001a875426","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"force-carrying particles","answer_start":472}],"question":"Interactions between quarks and leptons are the exchange of what?","id":"5a7e05ef70df9f001a875427","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"matter","answer_start":711}],"question":"Mass and energy can always be compared to what?","id":"5a7e05ef70df9f001a875428","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Planck","answer_start":953}],"question":"What relation explains the carriers of the electric force?","id":"5a7e05ef70df9f001a875429","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"These quarks and leptons interact through four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions. The Standard Model of particle physics currently the best explanation for all of physics, but despite no decades of efforts, gravity cannot yet be accounted for at quantum no level; it is only described by classical physics (see quantum gravity and graviton). Interactions between quarks and leptons the result of an exchange of force-carrying particles (such as photons) between quarks and leptons. The force-carrying particles ain't themselves building blocks. As one no consequence, mass and energy (which cannot be created or destroyed) cannot always be related to no matter (which can be created out of non-matter particles such as photons, or even out of pure energy, such as kinetic energy). Force carriers are usually not considered matter: the carriers of the electric force (photons) possess energy (see Planck relation) and the carriers of the weak force (W and Z bosons) massive, but neither are considered matter either. However, while these particles ain't considered matter, they contribute to the total mass of atoms, subatomic particles, and all systems contain them."}]}}}
