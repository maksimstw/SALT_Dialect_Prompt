friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyonc\u00e9 later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyonc\u00e9's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyonc\u00e9's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyonc\u00e9's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records."},{"qas":[{"question":"Beyonce got married in 2008 to whom?","id":"56be95823aeaaa14008c910c","answers":[{"text":"Jay Z","answer_start":34}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Her third album, \"I am...Sasha Fierce\" was released when?","id":"56be95823aeaaa14008c910d","answers":[{"text":"November 18, 2008","answer_start":253}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"For which decade, did Beyonce have more top ten songs than any other woman?","id":"56be95823aeaaa14008c910e","answers":[{"text":"2000s","answer_start":897}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which singer beat out Beyonce for best video performance?","id":"56be95823aeaaa14008c910f","answers":[{"text":"Taylor Swift","answer_start":1567}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In 2009, Beyonce started her second world tour and grossed how much money?","id":"56be95823aeaaa14008c9110","answers":[{"text":"119.5 million","answer_start":1881}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How did she reveal the marriage?","id":"56bf97aba10cfb140055119e","answers":[{"text":"in a video montage","answer_start":78}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did Beyonce begin her second world tour?","id":"56bf97aba10cfb140055119f","answers":[{"text":"March 2009","answer_start":1744}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who beat out Beyonce for Best Female Video ?","id":"56bf97aba10cfb14005511a0","answers":[{"text":"Taylor Swift","answer_start":1567}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much did the second world tour make in dollars?","id":"56bf97aba10cfb14005511a1","answers":[{"text":"119.5 million","answer_start":1881}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did Beyonc\u00e9 get married?","id":"56d4bf242ccc5a1400d831be","answers":[{"text":"April 4, 2008","answer_start":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who did Beyonc\u00e9 marry?","id":"56d4bf242ccc5a1400d831bf","answers":[{"text":"Jay Z.","answer_start":34}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who is Beyonc\u00e9's alter ego?","id":"56d4bf242ccc5a1400d831c0","answers":[{"text":"Sasha Fierce","answer_start":156}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The video for what song won Beyonc\u00e9 the 2009 MTV Video of the Year award?","id":"56d4bf242ccc5a1400d831c1","answers":[{"text":"Single Ladies","answer_start":605}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which prominent star felt the 2009 Female Video of the Year award should have went to Beyonc\u00e9 instead of Taylor Swift?","id":"56d4bf242ccc5a1400d831c2","answers":[{"text":"Kanye West","answer_start":1611}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"On April 4, 2008, Beyonc\u00e9 married Jay Z. She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyonc\u00e9's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \"Crazy in Love\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyonc\u00e9 her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and the top-five songs \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"'s success in the US helped Beyonc\u00e9 attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \"Sweet Dreams\", and singles \"Diva\", \"Ego\", \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" and \"Video Phone\". The music video for \"Single Ladies\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's \"You Belong with Me\", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyonc\u00e9 improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech. In March 2009, Beyonc\u00e9 embarked on the I Am...

They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the \"Most Powerful Women in the World\" list in 2010. The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the \"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyonc\u00e9 at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals. In the same year, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z placed at number one on the \"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\", for collectively earning $78 million. The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the \"highest-earning power couple\" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009. For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyonc\u00e9 earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012. In 2013, Beyonc\u00e9's endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay Z the world's first billion dollar couple in the music industry.

Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's Hexameron; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme.

Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\".

Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: \"I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ...

As for the Tibetan view that Tibet was never subject to the rule of the Yuan or Qing emperors of China, Sperling also discounts this by stating that Tibet was \"subject to rules, laws and decisions made by the Yuan and Qing rulers\" and that even Tibetans described themselves as subjects of these emperors."},{"qas":[{"question":"When was Tibet included into the territory of Yuan dynasty's China?","id":"56ce2b2daab44d1400b884f0","answers":[{"text":"the 13th century","answer_start":202}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was said to have gained the right to rule Tibet?","id":"56ce2b2daab44d1400b884f1","answers":[{"text":"the Ming dynasty","answer_start":320}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was China Daily started?","id":"56ce2b2daab44d1400b884f2","answers":[{"text":"1981","answer_start":54}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who does the article claim had two itinerant high commands over Tibet?","id":"56ce2b2daab44d1400b884f3","answers":[{"text":"the Ming","answer_start":320}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"According to article Tibet has remained under what jurisdiction?","id":"56ce2b2daab44d1400b884f4","answers":[{"text":"the central government of China","answer_start":266}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"China Daily, a CCP-controlled news organization since 1981, states in a 2008 article that although there were dynastic changes after Tibet was incorporated into the territory of Yuan dynasty's China in the 13th century, \"Tibet has remained under the jurisdiction of the central government of China.\" It also states that the Ming dynasty \"inherited the right to rule Tibet\" from the Yuan dynasty, and repeats the claims in the Mingshi about the Ming establishing two itinerant high commands over Tibet.

The second successor of this first Tsang king, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, took control of the whole of Central Tibet (\u00dc-Tsang), reigning from 1611\u20131621. Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Gelug, while the \u00dc-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa. Tensions rose between the nationalistic \u00dc-Tsang ruler and the Mongols who safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the \u00dc-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Gelug monasteries. Chen writes of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama's mysterious death and the plot of the \u00dc-Tsang king to have him murdered for \"cursing\" him with illness, although Chen writes that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle. In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso died, the Gelug and the Karma Kargyu went to war, the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular \u00dc-Tsang king. The \u00dc-Tsang ruler had a large number of Gelugpa lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at Drepung and Sera, and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama. In 1621, the \u00dc-Tsang king died and was succeeded by his young son Karma Tenkyong, an event which stymied the war effort as the latter accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new Dalai Lama. Despite the new Dalai Lama's diplomatic efforts to maintain friendly relations with the new \u00dc-Tsang ruler, Sonam Rapten (1595\u20131657), the Dalai Lama's chief steward and treasurer at Drepung, made efforts to overthrow the \u00dc-Tsang king, which led to another conflict. In 1633, the Gelugpas and several thousand Mongol adherents defeated the \u00dc-Tsang king's troops near Lhasa before a peaceful negotiation was settled. Goldstein writes that in this the \"Mongols were again playing a significant role in Tibetan affairs, this time as the military arm of the Dalai Lama.\""},{"qas":[{"question":"Who did the the Chinese Ming dynasty fall to?","id":"56ce4f64aab44d1400b886a2","answers":[{"text":"the rebellion of Li Zicheng","answer_start":44}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"According to Kolma\u0161 who accepted an invite from a Manchu to send envoys to the capital at Mukden?","id":"56ce4f64aab44d1400b886a5","answers":[{"text":"the Dalai Lama","answer_start":373}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was said to have treated the Dalai Lama as an independent sovereign of Tibet?","id":"56ce4f64aab44d1400b886a6","answers":[{"text":"Shunzhi","answer_start":630}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Meanwhile, the Chinese Ming dynasty fell to the rebellion of Li Zicheng (1606\u20131645) in 1644, yet his short-lived Shun dynasty was crushed by the Manchu invasion and the Han Chinese general Wu Sangui (1612\u20131678). China Daily states that when the following Qing dynasty replaced the Ming dynasty, it merely \"strengthened administration of Tibet.\" However, Kolma\u0161 states that the Dalai Lama was very observant of what was going on in China and accepted a Manchu invitation in 1640 to send envoys to their capital at Mukden in 1642, before the Ming collapsed. Dawa Norbu, William Rockhill, and George N. Patterson write that when the Shunzhi Emperor (r. 1644\u20131661) of the subsequent Qing dynasty invited the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso to Beijing in 1652, Shunzhi treated the Dalai Lama as an independent sovereign of Tibet. Patterson writes that this was an effort of Shunzhi to secure an alliance with Tibet that would ultimately lead to the establishment of Manchu rule over Mongolia. In this meeting with the Qing emperor, Goldstein asserts that the Dalai Lama was not someone to be trifled with due to his alliance with Mongol tribes, some of which were declared enemies of the Qing.

However, they discover that the mirror is broken. The Sages there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but he was only able to shatter it into fragments; only the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy the Mirror of Twilight. They also reveal that they used it a century ago to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who attempted to steal the Triforce, to the Twilight Realm when executing him failed. Assisted by an underground resistance group they meet in Castle Town, Link and Midna set out to retrieve the missing shards of the Mirror, defeating those they infected.

Game Informer called it \"so creative that it rivals the best that Hollywood has to offer\". GamesRadar praised Twilight Princess as \"a game that deserves nothing but the absolute highest recommendation\". Cubed3 hailed Twilight Princess as \"the single greatest videogame experience\". Twilight Princess's graphics were praised for the art style and animation, although the game was designed for the GameCube, which is technically lacking compared to the next generation consoles. Both IGN and GameSpy pointed out the existence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters. Despite these complaints, Computer and Video Games felt the game's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game, and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created. PALGN praised the game's cinematics, noting that \"the cutscenes are the best ever in Zelda games\". Regarding the Wii version, GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann said the Wii controls felt \"tacked-on\", although 1UP.com said the remote-swinging sword attacks were \"the most impressive in the entire series\". Gaming Nexus considered Twilight Princess's soundtrack to be the best of this generation, though IGN criticized its MIDI-formatted songs for lacking \"the punch and crispness\" of their orchestrated counterparts. Hyper's Javier Glickman commended the game for its \"very long quests, superb Wii controls and being able to save anytime\".

In a lukewarm review for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, describing Spectre as inconsistent and unable to capitalise on its potential. Kenneth Turan, reviewing the film for Los Angeles Times, concluded that Spectre \"comes off as exhausted and uninspired\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times panned the film as having \"nothing surprising\" and sacrificing its originality for the sake of box office returns. Forbes' Scott Mendelson also heavily criticised the film, denouncing Spectre as \"the worst 007 movie in 30 years\". Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly viewed Spectre as \"an overreaction to our current blockbuster moment\", aspiring \"to be a serialized sequel\" and proving \"itself as a Saga\". While noting that \"[n]othing that happens in Spectre holds up to even minor logical scrutiny\", he had \"come not to bury Spectre, but to weirdly praise it. Because the final act of the movie is so strange, so willfully obtuse, that it deserves extra attention.\" In a positive review Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing \"The 24th movie about the British MI6 agent with a license to kill is party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies\". Other positive reviews from Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle, gave it a perfect 100 score, stating: \u201cOne of the great satisfactions of Spectre is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone\u2019s personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person.\u201d Stephen Whitty from the New York Daily News, gave it an 80 grade, saying: \u201cCraig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin.

Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking\u2014of education, the justice system, and her own society by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Jem trap a fellow peer of school in the story?","id":"56ce6dabaab44d1400b8877f","answers":[{"text":"church basement","answer_start":139}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of the maid who works in the Finch's household?","id":"56ce6dabaab44d1400b88780","answers":[{"text":"Calpurnia","answer_start":236}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How does Scout respond to the audience?","id":"56d14361e7d4791d00902051","answers":[{"text":"distracted and embarrassed","answer_start":510}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What saves Scout's life?","id":"56d14361e7d4791d00902052","answers":[{"text":"ham costume","answer_start":572}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Critics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot.

The grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house, and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson contribute to the aura of the Gothic in the novel. Lee used the term \"Gothic\" to describe the architecture of Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley. Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem's questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to Catcher in the Rye and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Despite challenging the town's systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one's conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social ostracism. However, scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification, noting that Boo Radley is in fact human, protective, and benevolent. Furthermore, in addressing themes such as alcoholism, incest, rape, and racial violence, Lee wrote about her small town realistically rather than melodramatically.

Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood.

Tom Robinson's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury's decision. Furthermore, the victim of racial injustice in To Kill a Mockingbird was physically impaired, which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of, but also crippled him in other ways.

Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout\/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\""},{"qas":[{"question":"In the book, which character was expected of molesting their child?","id":"56cf4b72aab44d1400b88f75","answers":[{"text":"Bob Ewell","answer_start":273}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was the only non-abusive father mentioned?","id":"56d2581659d6e41400145edc","answers":[{"text":"Atticus","answer_start":229}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel.

The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\" Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season?

The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \"Watchman\" was seen as just the first draft of \"Mockingbird\".

Writing a decade later, another scholar noted, \"Harper Lee has a remarkable gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition.\" Lee combines the narrator's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman's reflecting on her childhood, using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives. This narrative method allows Lee to tell a \"delightfully deceptive\" story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition. However, at times the blending causes reviewers to question Scout's preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding. Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary critic Granville Hicks expressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson's life."},{"qas":[{"question":"Besides the children's fascination with Boo, the first part of the book was concerned about their feelings for what?","id":"56d196b2e7d4791d00902067","answers":[{"text":"the neighborhood","answer_start":263}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Lee's detailed explanations of the characters' behaviors caused one writer to catagorize the book as what?","id":"56d196b2e7d4791d00902068","answers":[{"text":"Southern romantic regionalism","answer_start":489}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Scout defined people doing the best they could with what they had as who?","id":"56d196b2e7d4791d00902069","answers":[{"text":"fine folks","answer_start":1110}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What drives the plot of the book more than the characters?","id":"56d196b2e7d4791d0090206a","answers":[{"text":"The South itself","answer_start":1197}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"When the book was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them. The first part of the novel concerns the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood. Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism. This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to genealogy (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks), and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of \"fine folks\" being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have. The South itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters."},{"qas":[{"question":"Who is the main example of an innocent destroyed in the novel?","id":"56d261f359d6e41400145f36","answers":[{"text":"Tom Robinson","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What  does Scout see symbollically as a mockingbird?","id":"56d261f359d6e41400145f37","answers":[{"text":"Boo Radley","answer_start":182}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"According to Atticus, most people are how when you truly view them?","id":"56d261f359d6e41400145f38","answers":[{"text":"real nice","answer_start":747}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Tom Robinson is the chief example among several innocents destroyed carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel.

She guides the reader in such judgments, alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony. Scout's experience with the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her, gossip, and \"reflect a smug, colonialist attitude toward other races\" while giving the \"appearance of gentility, piety, and morality\".

Jane Sullivan in the Sydney Morning Herald agrees, stating that the book \"still rouses fresh and horrified indignation\" as it examines morality, a topic that has recently become unfashionable. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writing in The Guardian states that Lee, rare among American novelists, writes with \"a fiercely progressive ink, in which there is nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question\", comparing her to William Faulkner, who wrote about racism as an inevitability.

The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. \"Jesus Walks\", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records.

Rosie Swash of The Guardian viewed the sales competition as a historical moment in hip-hop, because it \"highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative.\" Rolling Stone credited West with transforming hip hop's mainstream, \"establishing a style of introspective yet glossy rap [...]\", and called him \"as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produced\u2014a rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful things to say about college, culture and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up.\" His 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak polarized both listeners and critics upon its release, but was commercially successful and impacted hip hop and pop stylistically, as it laid the groundwork for a new wave of artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, Drake, Future, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Lil Durk, Chief Keef, and Soulja Boy. According to Ben Detrick of XXL magazine, West effectively led a new wave of artists, including Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, and Drake, who lacked the interest or ability to rap about gunplay or drug-dealing."},{"qas":[{"question":"A number of artists have cited Kanye as being what to them?","id":"56cf87de234ae51400d9be07","answers":[{"text":"influential","answer_start":1130}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who complimented West in Time Magazine?","id":"56d133ee17492d1400aabc30","answers":[{"text":"inventor Elon Musk","answer_start":1053}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"A substantial number of artists and other figures have been influenced by, or complimented, West's work, including hip hop artists RZA of Wu-Tang Clan, Chuck D of Public Enemy, and DJ Premier of Gang Starr.

Nagarjuna's primary contribution to Buddhist philosophy was the systematic exposition of the concept of \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101, or \"emptiness\", widely attested in the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 sutras that emerged in his era. The concept of emptiness brings together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anatta and dependent origination, to refute the metaphysics of Sarvastivada and Sautrantika (extinct non-Mahayana schools). For Nagarjuna, it is not merely sentient beings that are empty of \u0101tman; all phenomena (dharmas) are without any svabhava (literally \"own-nature\" or \"self-nature\"), and thus without any underlying essence; they are \"empty\" of being independent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism. Nagarjuna's school of thought is known as the M\u0101dhyamaka. Some of the writings attributed to Nagarjuna made explicit references to Mahayana texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the agamas. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the Canon. In the eyes of Nagarjuna the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the M\u0101dhyamaka system."},{"qas":[{"question":"What does Bodhisattva mean?","id":"56d1fc6ae7d4791d009025d1","answers":[{"text":"enlightenment being","answer_start":19}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the term for the spontaneous wish to attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all beings?","id":"56d1fc6ae7d4791d009025d2","answers":[{"text":"bodhicitta","answer_start":192}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Bodhisattva means \"enlightenment being\", and generally refers to one who is on the path to buddhahood.

The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather."},{"qas":[{"question":"What type of working dog may have been the reason so many humans were able to get into North America 12,000 tears ago?","id":"56d629291c85041400946f48","answers":[{"text":"sled dogs","answer_start":160}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did ancient people walk across from Siberia into North America?","id":"56d629291c85041400946f49","answers":[{"text":"Bering land bridge","answer_start":46}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How old are the oldest findings of dogs in North America?","id":"56d629291c85041400946f4a","answers":[{"text":"9,400 years","answer_start":373}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Evidence places dogs in North America when?","id":"56d9c708dc89441400fdb7fa","answers":[{"text":"12,000 years ago","answer_start":256}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Dogs were the only domesticated animals for what North American population?","id":"56d9c708dc89441400fdb7fb","answers":[{"text":"Athabascan","answer_start":438}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Dogs contributed to what migration 1400 years ago?","id":"56d9c708dc89441400fdb7fc","answers":[{"text":"Apache and Navajo tribes","answer_start":578}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"People still used dogs as pack animals even after what other animal began being used for this purpose?","id":"56d9c708dc89441400fdb7fd","answers":[{"text":"horse","answer_start":712}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Emigrants from Siberia that walked across the Bering land bridge into North America may have had dogs in their company, and one writer suggests that the use of sled dogs may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered North America roughly 12,000 years ago, although the earliest archaeological evidence of dog-like canids in North America dates from about 9,400 years ago.:104 Dogs were an important part of life for the Athabascan population in North America, and were their only domesticated animal.

One demonstrator was quoted as saying that the route changes were an effort to \"thwart any organized protest that had been planned.\" San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, a critic of Mayor Gavin Newsom, said that it was a \"cynical plan to please the Bush State Department and the Chinese government because of the incredible influence of money.\" Newsom, on the other hand, said he felt it was in \"everyone's best interest\" and that he believed people had been \"afforded the right to protest and support the torch\" despite the route changes. Peter Ueberroth, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee, praised the route changes, saying, \"The city of San Francisco, from a global perspective, will be applauded.\" People who saw the torch were surprised and cheered as shown from live video of CBS and NBC. The cost to the city for hosting the event was reported to be USD $726,400, nearly half of which has been recovered by private fundraising.

A consequence of that is a wider ranging curriculum, including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational learning, which were less common or non-existent in grammar schools. Providing post-16 education cost-effectively becomes more challenging for smaller comprehensive schools, because of the number of courses needed to cover a broader curriculum with comparatively fewer students. This is why schools have tended to get larger and also why many local authorities have organised secondary education into 11\u201316 schools, with the post-16 provision provided by Sixth Form colleges and Further Education Colleges. Comprehensive schools do not select their intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, but there are demographic reasons why the attainment profiles of different schools vary considerably.

In the selective school system, which survives in several parts of the United Kingdom, admission is dependent on selection criteria, most commonly a cognitive test or tests. Although comprehensive schools were introduced to England and Wales in 1965, there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation.[citation needed] (though this is a small number compared to approximately 3500 state secondary schools in England). Most comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 to 16, but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places the secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US middle school (or junior high school) and high school, respectively.

In many cases polytechnic were elite technological universities concentrating on applied science and engineering and may also be a former designation for a vocational institution, before it has been granted the exclusive right to award academic degrees and can be truly called an institute of technology. A number of polytechnics providing higher education is simply a result of a formal upgrading from their original and historical role as intermediate technical education schools. In some situations, former polytechnics or other non-university institutions have emerged solely through an administrative change of statutes, which often included a name change with the introduction of new designations like institute of technology, polytechnic university, university of applied sciences, or university of technology for marketing purposes. Such emergence of so many upgraded polytechnics, former vocational education and technical schools converted into more university-like institutions has caused concern where the lack of specialized intermediate technical professionals lead to industrial skill shortages in some fields, being also associated to an increase of the graduate unemployment rate. This is mostly the case in those countries, where the education system is not controlled by the state and everybody can grant degrees.[citation needed] Evidence have also shown a decline in the general quality of teaching and graduate's preparation for the workplace, due to the fast-paced conversion of that technical institutions to more advanced higher level institutions.

Competition is where a larger or stronger organisms deprives a smaller or weaker one from a resource. Antibiosis occurs when one organism is damaged or killed by another through a chemical secretion. An example of competition is a sapling growing under the shadow of a mature tree. The mature tree can begin to rob the sapling of necessary sunlight and, if the mature tree is very large, it can take up rainwater and deplete soil nutrients. Throughout the process the mature tree is unaffected. Indeed, if the sapling dies, the mature tree gains nutrients from the decaying sapling. Note that these nutrients become available because of the sapling's decomposition, rather than from the living sapling, which would be a case of parasitism.[citation needed] An example of antibiosis is Juglans nigra (black walnut), secreting juglone, a substance which destroys many herbaceous plants within its root zone."}]},"23":{"title":"Canadian_Armed_Forces","paragraphs":[]},"24":{"title":"Cardinal_(Catholicism)","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"In early times, who was generally electied to cardinal?","id":"56ddf1759a695914005b9706","answers":[{"text":"a Roman priest","answer_start":136}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Why did the ceromony of consecrating a bishop have to be preformed by someone who was already a bishop?","id":"56ddf1759a695914005b9707","answers":[{"text":"To preserve apostolic succession","answer_start":186}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the rule if the peson elected is not a bishop?

In addition, there has been an increased separation of the 'design' architect [Notes 1] from the 'project' architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability.[Notes 2] The preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws. A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many. Modernism and Postmodernism have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences."},{"qas":[{"question":"What issue has moved to the forefront in recent years?","id":"56e4ceac8c00841900fbaff5","answers":[{"text":"Environmental sustainability","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What do architecture schools look at more and more nowadays?","id":"56e4ceac8c00841900fbaff6","answers":[{"text":"the environment","answer_start":579}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was the first to design architecture environmentally?","id":"56e4ceac8c00841900fbaff7","answers":[{"text":"Frank Lloyd Wright","answer_start":644}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was known for focusing on the environment in the 1960s?","id":"56e4ceac8c00841900fbaff8","answers":[{"text":"Buckminster Fuller","answer_start":680}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What organization's rating system promotes sustainability?","id":"56e4ceac8c00841900fbaff9","answers":[{"text":"The U.S. Green Building Council","answer_start":1130}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Environmental sustainability","answer_start":0}],"question":"What issue has moved to the forefront in past years?","id":"5acfb28f77cf76001a685936","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the environment","answer_start":579}],"question":" What do architecture schools look at less and less nowadays?","id":"5acfb28f77cf76001a685937","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Frank Lloyd Wright","answer_start":644}],"question":" Who was the last to design architecture environmentally?","id":"5acfb28f77cf76001a685938","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Buckminster Fuller","answer_start":680}],"question":" Who was known for focusing on the environment in the 1970s?","id":"5acfb28f77cf76001a685939","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"U.S. Green Building Council's LEED","answer_start":1134}],"question":"What organization's rating system discourages sustainability?","id":"5acfb28f77cf76001a68593a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Environmental sustainability has become a mainstream issue, with profound effect on the architectural profession.

Major examples of this can be found in Passive solar building design, greener roof designs, biodegradable materials, and more attention to a structure's energy usage. This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. Sustainability in architecture was pioneered by Frank Lloyd Wright, in the 1960s by Buckminster Fuller and in the 1970s by architects such as Ian McHarg and Sim Van der Ryn in the US and Brenda and Robert Vale in the UK and New Zealand. There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet green building sustainable design principles. Sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques.

Under Edward VI, the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by Mary I; even so two radicals were executed in Edward's reign (one for denying the reality of the incarnation, the other for denying Christ's divinity). Under Mary, around two hundred and ninety people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of papal jurisdiction. When Elizabeth I came to the throne, the concept of heresy was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 Act of Supremacy and the one hundred and eighty or so Catholics who were executed in the forty-five years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of \"...a subversive fifth column.\" The last execution of a \"heretic\" in England occurred under James VI and I in 1612.

However, based on the historical community of peoples, relations between them, given the bilateral treaties, the desire for a democratic rule of law, the intention to develop their relations based on mutual recognition and respect for state sovereignty, the parties agreed to the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. On December 12, the agreement was ratified by the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR by an overwhelming majority: 188 votes for, 6 against, 7 abstentions. On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and recalled all Russian deputies from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The legality of this act is the subject of discussions because, according to the 1978 Constitution (Basic Law) of the Russian SFSR, the Russian Supreme Soviet had no right to do so. However, by this time the Soviet government had been rendered more or less impotent, and was in no position to object. Although the December 12 vote is sometimes reckoned as the moment that the RSFSR seceded from the collapsing Soviet Union, this is not the case.

David Carrier's The Aesthetics of Comics (2000) was the first full-length treatment of comics from a philosophical perspective. Prominent American attempts at definitions of comics include Eisner's, McCloud's, and Harvey's. Eisner described what he called \"sequential art\" as \"the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea\"; Scott McCloud defined comics \"juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and\/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer\", a strictly formal definition which detached comics from its historical and cultural trappings. R. C. Harvey defined comics as \"pictorial narratives or expositions in which words (often lettered into the picture area within speech balloons) usually contribute to the meaning of the pictures and vice versa\". Each definition has had its detractors. Harvey saw McCloud's definition as excluding single-panel cartoons, and objected to McCloud's de-emphasizing verbal elements, insisting \"the essential characteristic of comics is the incorporation of verbal content\". Aaron Meskin saw McCloud's theories as an artificial attempt to legitimize the place of comics in art history."},{"qas":[{"question":"In the 1840s, T\u00f6pffer wrote theories about whose work?","id":"56e039097aa994140058e3bf","answers":[{"text":"his own","answer_start":57}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who introduced the term \"multiframe\"?","id":"56e039097aa994140058e3c0","answers":[{"text":"Henri Vanlier","answer_start":423}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who used a semiotics method to study comics in the 1970s?","id":"56e039097aa994140058e3c2","answers":[{"text":"Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle","answer_start":200}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who used cognitive science to learn how people understand comics?","id":"56e039097aa994140058e3c3","answers":[{"text":"Neil Cohn","answer_start":1096}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"his own","answer_start":57}],"question":"In the 1940s, T\u00f6pffer wrote theories about whose work?","id":"5acf902777cf76001a685288","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Henri Vanlier","answer_start":423}],"question":"Who rejected the term \"multiframe\"?","id":"5acf902777cf76001a685289","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle","answer_start":200}],"question":"Who never used a semiotics method to study comics in the 1970s","id":"5acf902777cf76001a68528a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle","answer_start":200}],"question":"Who used a semiotics method to study comics in the 1980s","id":"5acf902777cf76001a68528b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Neil Cohn","answer_start":1096}],"question":"Who used cognitive science to learn how dogs understand comics?","id":"5acf902777cf76001a68528c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"European comics studies began with T\u00f6pffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual\u2013verbal combination.

In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \"multiframe\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit.

Morgan sees comics as a subset of \"les litt\u00e9ratures dessin\u00e9es\" (or \"drawn literatures\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \"grammars\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music."}]},"47":{"title":"Saint_Helena","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"How many square miles is Saint Helena?","id":"56e06714231d4119001ac09f","answers":[{"text":"47","answer_start":56}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kind of rock are coastal regions of Saint Helena covered with?","id":"56e06714231d4119001ac0a0","answers":[{"text":"volcanic","answer_start":112}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many feet high is the highest peak of Saint Helena?","id":"56e06714231d4119001ac0a1","answers":[{"text":"2,684","answer_start":333}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What year did Diana's Peak officially become a state park?","id":"56e06714231d4119001ac0a2","answers":[{"text":"1996","answer_start":347}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was formed in 2002 to replant parts of the great wood?","id":"56e06714231d4119001ac0a3","answers":[{"text":"Millennium Forest project","answer_start":559}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"The island of Saint Helena has a total area of 122 km2 (47 sq mi), and is composed largely of rugged terrain of volcanic origin (the last volcanic eruptions occurred about 7 million years ago).

The island's hinterland must have been a dense tropical forest but the coastal areas were probably also quite green. The modern landscape is very different, with widespread bare rock in the lower areas, although inland it is green, mainly due to introduced vegetation. There are no native land mammals, but cattle, cats, dogs, donkeys, goats, mice, rabbits, rats and sheep have been introduced, and native species have been adversely affected as a result.

An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, which used to be a primary use of electricity.

The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the \"Three Furnacelike Cities\" along the Yangtze River (\u957f\u6c5f\u6d41\u57df\u4e09\u5927\u706b\u7089) for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the plum blossom blooming season in which the meiyu (rainy season of East Asia; literally \"plum rain\") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around 15.46 \u00b0C (59.8 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 2.4 \u00b0C (36.3 \u00b0F) in January to 27.8 \u00b0C (82.0 \u00b0F) in July.

Also, the year also brought a spin-off league, the AF2, intended to be a developmental league, comparable to the National Football League's NFL Europe. There was a lot of expansion in the 2000s.

These various Latin-derived regional languages are therefore, in a linguistic sense, not truly \"dialects\" of the standard Italian language, but are instead better defined as their own separate languages.

For instance, a speaker of purely Eastern Lombard, a language in Northern Italy's Lombardy region that includes the Bergamasque dialect, would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely standard Italian speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure Sicilian language variant. Due to Eastern Lombard's status as a Gallo-Italic language, an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a Occitan, Catalan, or French speaker than a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker.

The Eclogues (from the Greek for \"selections\") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry (\"pastoral poetry\") of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus. After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar, Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, supposedly including, according to the tradition, an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil. The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil's motives in the composition of the Eclogues. This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues. In Eclogues 1 and 9, Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom, but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident. While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (Ecl. 1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, Ecl. 2), or a master singer's claim to have composed several eclogues (Ecl. 5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret an author's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought. The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective. Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside. 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (Ecl. 2) and attraction toward people of any gender (Ecl. 3). Eclogue 4, addressed to Asinius Pollio, the so-called \"Messianic Eclogue\" uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate). 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus. Virgil is credited[by whom?] in the Eclogues with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus, Nemesianus, and later writers."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which long didactic hexameter poem did Virgil work on for several years?","id":"56f8961a9e9bad19000a018b","answers":[{"text":"Georgics","answer_start":150}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"To whom was Georgics dedicated to?","id":"56f8961a9e9bad19000a018c","answers":[{"text":"Maecenas","answer_start":218}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The theme of Georgics is instruction in the methods of what?","id":"56f8961a9e9bad19000a018d","answers":[{"text":"running a farm","answer_start":298}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which of Virgil's poet friends committed suicide in 26 BC?","id":"56f8961a9e9bad19000a018e","answers":[{"text":"Gallus","answer_start":1174}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was Gallus disgraced by?","id":"56f8961a9e9bad19000a018f","answers":[{"text":"Augustus","answer_start":1203}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Aristaeus","answer_start":947}],"question":"Who discovered how to raise crops?","id":"5a7e48f570df9f001a875687","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"4","answer_start":817}],"question":"How many poems did Hesiod write?","id":"5a7e48f570df9f001a875688","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"beekeeping","answer_start":600}],"question":"What did the poet Gallus write about most?","id":"5a7e48f570df9f001a875689","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"raising crops","answer_start":535}],"question":"What was Maecenas' profession?","id":"5a7e48f570df9f001a87568a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"hexameter","answer_start":124}],"question":"What kind of poems did Hesiod write?","id":"5a7e48f570df9f001a87568b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"At Maecenas' insistence (according to the tradition) Virgil spent the ensuing years (perhaps 37\u201329 BC) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the Georgics (from Greek, \"On Working the Earth\") which he dedicated to Maecenas. The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of running a farm. In handling this theme, Virgil follows in the didactic (\"how to\") tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets. The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on raising crops and trees (1 and 2), livestock and horses (3), and beekeeping and the qualities of bees (4). Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2, the prologue description of the temple in Book 3, and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3. Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative, in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus' journey to the underworld.

The epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse which describe the journey of Aeneas, a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy, to Italy, his battle with the Italian prince Turnus, and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge. The Aeneid's first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome. Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic; Homer, the preeminent author of classical epic, is everywhere present, but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes among the various other writers to which he alludes. Although the Aeneid casts itself firmly into the epic mode, it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry.

The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1\u20132, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers. With almost every line of his epic Punica Silius references Virgil. Indeed, Silius is known to have bought Virgil's tomb and worshipped the poet. Partially as a result of his so-called \"Messianic\" Fourth Eclogue\u2014widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ\u2014Virgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer; the Sortes Vergilianae, the process of using Virgil's poetry as a tool of divination, is found in the time of Hadrian, and continued into the Middle Ages. In a similar vein Macrobius in the Saturnalia credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience, mirroring the Greek conception of Homer. Virgil also found commentators in antiquity. Servius, a commentator of the 4th century AD, based his work on the commentary of Donatus. Servius' commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Virgil's life, sources, and references; however, many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating."}]},"80":{"title":"Alps","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What are the crescent shaped geographic feature of central Europe?","id":"56f8752baef23719006260b6","answers":[{"text":"The Alps","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the mean height of the Alp's peak?","id":"56f8752baef23719006260b7","answers":[{"text":"2.5 km (1.6 mi)","answer_start":197}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How far does the Alps range stretch?","id":"56f8752baef23719006260b8","answers":[{"text":"the Mediterranean Sea north above the Po basin, extending through France from Grenoble, eastward through mid and southern Switzerland","answer_start":239}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Switzerland, France, Austria and Italy have the greatest what?

Elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the polar regions have been called Alpine. A rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease (see adiabatic lapse rate). The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain. The height of the Alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and a dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks."}]},"81":{"title":"Gene","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What is a gene?","id":"56f88b90aef2371900626166","answers":[{"text":"a locus (or region) of DNA that encodes a functional RNA or protein product","answer_start":11}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the basis of inheritance of phenotypic traits?","id":"56f88b90aef2371900626167","answers":[{"text":"The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring","answer_start":136}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What influence are most biological traits under?","id":"56f88b90aef2371900626168","answers":[{"text":"polygenes (many different genes)","answer_start":293}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is one instantly visible genetic trait?","id":"56f88b90aef2371900626169","answers":[{"text":"eye colour or number of limbs","answer_start":423}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is one invisible genetic trait?","id":"56f88b90aef237190062616a","answers":[{"text":"blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life","answer_start":480}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"\nA gene is a locus (or region) of DNA that encodes a functional RNA or protein product, and is the molecular unit of heredity.:Glossary The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits.

The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand.

The CIA was first formed under the National Security Act of 1947 from the army's Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which furnished both military intelligence and clandestine military operations to the army during the crisis of World War II. Many revisions and redefinitions have taken place since then. Although the name of the CIA reflects the original advised intent of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, the government's needs for strategic services have frustrated that intent from the beginning. The press received by the agency in countless articles, novels and other media have tended to create various popular myths; for example, that this agency replaced any intelligence effort other than that of the OSS, or that it contains the central intelligence capability of the United States. Strategic services are officially provided by some 17 agencies called the Intelligence Community. Army intelligence did not come to an end; in fact, all the branches of the Armed Forces retained their intelligence services.

Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as the Hundred Yue, including the Dongyue and the Ouyue. The kingdom of Yue began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the Spring and Autumn Period. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was located in northern Zhejiang. Shiji claims that its leaders were descended from the Shang founder Yu the Great. Evidence suggests that Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue possessed their own culture and history that are different from those kingdoms in north and central China, whose cultures and histories were carefully recorded in chronicles and histories during the Spring and Autumn Period and into the Qin dynasty. The Song of the Yue Boatman (Chinese: \u8d8a\u4eba\u6b4c, p Yu\u00e8r\u00e9n G\u0113, lit. \"Song of the man of Yue\") was transliterated into Chinese and recorded by authors in north China or inland China of Hebei and Henan around 528 BC. The song shows that the Yue people spoke a language that was mutually unintelligible with the dialects spoken in north and inland China. The Yue peoples seem to have had their own written script. The Sword of Goujian bears bird-worm seal script. Yuen\u00fc (Chinese: \u8d8a\u5973; pinyin: Yu\u00e8n\u01da; Wade\u2013Giles: Y\u00fceh-n\u00fc; literally: \"the Lady of Yue\") was a swordswoman from the state of Yue. In order to check the growth of the kingdom of Wu, Chu pursued a policy of strengthening Yue. Under King Goujian, Yue recovered from its early reverses and fully annexed the lands of its rival in 473 BC. The Yue kings then moved their capital center from their original home around Mount Kuaiji in present-day Shaoxing to the former Wu capital at present-day Suzhou. With no southern power to turn against Yue, Chu opposed it directly and, in 333 BC, succeeded in destroying it. Yue's former lands were annexed by the Qin Empire in 222 BC and organized into a commandery named for Kuaiji in Zhejiang but initially headquartered in Wu in Jiangsu."},{"qas":[{"question":"When was the Jin Dynasty?","id":"56f97f069e9bad19000a09cb","answers":[{"text":"265\u2013420","answer_start":88}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where did the clan of Zhuge Liang gather together?","id":"56f97f069e9bad19000a09cc","answers":[{"text":"Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun)","answer_start":623}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did Zhuge Village isolate itself until?","id":"56f97f069e9bad19000a09cd","answers":[{"text":"this day","answer_start":800}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kind of geography is in Zhejiang?","id":"56f97f069e9bad19000a09ce","answers":[{"text":"mountainous","answer_start":1028}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did Zhuge Liang live from?","id":"56f97f069e9bad19000a09cf","answers":[{"text":"181\u2013234","answer_start":426}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Jin dynasty","answer_start":75}],"question":"What dynasty ended in 265?","id":"5acfbb4977cf76001a685aee","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Jin dynasty","answer_start":75}],"question":"What dynasty started in 420?","id":"5acfbb4977cf76001a685aef","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"mountainous","answer_start":1028}],"question":" What kind of geography is not in Zhejiang?","id":"5acfbb4977cf76001a685af0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"recently","answer_start":819}],"question":" When did Zhuge Village expose itself until?","id":"5acfbb4977cf76001a685af1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Zhuge Liang","answer_start":413}],"question":"Who died in 181?","id":"5acfbb4977cf76001a685af2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181\u2013234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge\". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in south of the Yangtze River. However, considering the mountainous geography and relative lack of agrarian lands in Zhejiang, most of these refugees might have resided in some areas in south China beyond Zhejiang, where fertile agrarian lands and metropolitan resources were available, mainly north Jiangsu, west Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui,and provinces where less cohesive, organized regional governments had been in place. Metropolitan areas of Sichuan was another hub for refugees, given that the state of Shu had long been founded and ruled by political and military elites from the Central Plain and north China. Some refugees from the north China might have found residence in south China depending on their social status and military power in the north. The rump Jin state or the Southern Dynasties vied against some elite Chinese from the Central Plain and south of the Yangtze River."},{"qas":[{"question":"How many islands are along the rugged coastline of Zhejiang?","id":"56f989239b226e1400dd1536","answers":[{"text":"over three thousand","answer_start":10}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the largest island near Zhejiang?","id":"56f989239b226e1400dd1537","answers":[{"text":"Zhoushan Island","answer_start":91}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the largest bay of Zhejiang?","id":"56f989239b226e1400dd1538","answers":[{"text":"Hangzhou Bay","answer_start":213}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many distinct seasons does Zhejiang have?","id":"56f989239b226e1400dd1539","answers":[{"text":"four","answer_start":289}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When does Spring start in Zhejiang?","id":"56f989239b226e1400dd153a","answers":[{"text":"March","answer_start":329}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"over three thousand islands","answer_start":10}],"question":" How many islands are not along the rugged coastline of Zhejiang?","id":"5acfc08277cf76001a685ca0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Hangzhou Bay","answer_start":213}],"question":" What is the smallest bay of Zhejiang?","id":"5acfc08277cf76001a685ca1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"four","answer_start":289}],"question":" How many seasons does Zhejiang never have?","id":"5acfc08277cf76001a685ca2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"There are over three thousand islands along the rugged coastline of Zhejiang.

In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US$3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%.

The report also cites concerns over potential cuts in the defence science and technology research budget; implications of inappropriate estimation of Defence Inflation within budgetary processes; underfunding in the Equipment Programme; and a general concern over striking the appropriate balance over a short-term focus (Current Operations) and long-term consequences of failure to invest in the delivery of future UK defence capabilities on future combatants and campaigns. The then Secretary of State for Defence, Bob Ainsworth MP, reinforced this reprioritisation of focus on current operations and had not ruled out \"major shifts\" in defence spending.

Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as \"invasions\", they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Aspar (d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472), or Gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background. When the line of western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the Roman state. Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar, and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects. Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions. An important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities. Many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes, instead relying on granting them land or rents. This meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the taxation systems decayed. Warfare was common between and within the kingdoms. Slavery declined as the supply weakened, and society became more rural.[F]"},{"qas":[{"question":"In what century did the economic revival in the Eastern Roman Empire end?","id":"56fb623d8ddada1400cd63b9","answers":[{"text":"7th","answer_start":163}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In what century was there peace with one of Rome's traditional enemies?","id":"56fb623d8ddada1400cd63ba","answers":[{"text":"5th","answer_start":351}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where did most of the invasion in the Eastern Roman Empire take place?","id":"56fb623d8ddada1400cd63bb","answers":[{"text":"the Balkans","answer_start":258}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What year saw the completion of the Theodosian Code?","id":"56fb623d8ddada1400cd63bc","answers":[{"text":"438","answer_start":685}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was Emperor when the Corpus Juris Civilis was compiled?","id":"56fb623d8ddada1400cd63bd","answers":[{"text":"Justinian","answer_start":704}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century.

The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort\u2014the Theodosian Code\u2014was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527\u2013565), another compilation took place\u2014the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests. At the emperor's death, the Byzantines had control of most of Italy, North Africa, and a small foothold in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and setting the stage for the Muslim conquests, but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult."},{"qas":[{"question":"How many people might live in a large peasant settlement?","id":"56fb6409b28b3419009f1cf8","answers":[{"text":"700","answer_start":766}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was a way in which a free peasant might become an aristocrat?","id":"56fb6409b28b3419009f1cf9","answers":[{"text":"military service","answer_start":1216}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In what century did written records of peasant life begin to appear?","id":"56fb6409b28b3419009f1cfa","answers":[{"text":"9th","answer_start":218}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Along with aristocratic writers, where do contemporary written descriptions of peasants come from?","id":"56fb6409b28b3419009f1cfb","answers":[{"text":"law codes","answer_start":291}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What field produces most of the finding about peasants from this era?","id":"56fb6409b28b3419009f1cfc","answers":[{"text":"archaeology","answer_start":128}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Peasant society is much less documented than the nobility.

These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems.

Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work.

Although this only works during daylight hours, it does not use the position of the sun in any way. At this stage the bird is in the position of a boy scout with a compass but no map, until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use. With experience it learns various landmarks and this \"mapping\" is done by magnetites in the trigeminal system, which tell the bird how strong the field is.

Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage.

At birth, most of the immunoglobulin present is maternal IgG. Because IgM, IgD, IgE and IgA don\u2019t cross the placenta, they are almost undetectable at birth. Some IgA is provided by breast milk. These passively-acquired antibodies can protect the newborn for up to 18 months, but their response is usually short-lived and of low affinity. These antibodies can also produce a negative response. If a child is exposed to the antibody for a particular antigen before being exposed to the antigen itself then the child will produce a dampened response. Passively acquired maternal antibodies can suppress the antibody response to active immunization. Similarly the response of T-cells to vaccination differs in children compared to adults, and vaccines that induce Th1 responses in adults do not readily elicit these same responses in neonates.

Using a constant bit rate makes encoding simpler and faster. However, it is also possible to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file. These are known as Variable Bit Rate (VBR) files. The idea behind this is that, in any piece of audio, some parts will be much easier to compress, such as silence or music containing only a few instruments, while others will be more difficult to compress. So, the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts. With some encoders, it is possible to specify a given quality, and the encoder will vary the bit rate accordingly. Users who know a particular \"quality setting\" that is transparent to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music, and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate."}]},"101":{"title":"House_music","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"what club did the term 'house music' originate from?","id":"5706a62375f01819005e7cc8","answers":[{"text":"The Warehouse","answer_start":77}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"what city was the club The Warehouse located in?","id":"5706a62375f01819005e7cc9","answers":[{"text":"Chicago","answer_start":57}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"what years was the club The warehouse open?","id":"5706a62375f01819005e7cca","answers":[{"text":"1977 to 1983","answer_start":111}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"what types of people did the club The Warehouse attract?","id":"5706a62375f01819005e7ccb","answers":[{"text":"primarily black and gay","answer_start":156}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"who was the resident DJ at The Warehouse in Chicago?","id":"5706a62375f01819005e7ccc","answers":[{"text":"Frankie Knuckles","answer_start":241}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the Warehouse","answer_start":711}],"question":"What club did the term \"Warehouse music\" originate from?","id":"5ad2783ed7d075001a429560","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Chicago","answer_start":57}],"question":"What city was the club The Remix located in?","id":"5ad2783ed7d075001a429561","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1977 to 1983","answer_start":111}],"question":"What years was the club The Remix located in?","id":"5ad2783ed7d075001a429562","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"primarily black and gay","answer_start":156}],"question":"What types of people did the club The Remix attract?","id":"5ad2783ed7d075001a429563","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Frankie Knuckles","answer_start":241}],"question":"Who was the resident DJ at The Remix in Chicago?","id":"5ad2783ed7d075001a429564","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The term \"house music\" is said to have originated from a Chicago club called The Warehouse, which existed from 1977 to 1983.

At least one model shows that a temporal delay is unnecessary to produce an autocorrelation model of pitch perception, appealing to phase shifts between cochlear filters; however, earlier work has shown that certain sounds with a prominent peak in their autocorrelation function do not elicit a corresponding pitch percept, and that certain sounds without a peak in their autocorrelation function nevertheless elicit a pitch. To be a more complete model, autocorrelation must therefore apply to signals that represent the output of the cochlea, as via auditory-nerve interspike-interval histograms. Some theories of pitch perception hold that pitch has inherent octave ambiguities, and therefore is best decomposed into a pitch chroma, a periodic value around the octave, like the note names in western music\u2014and a pitch height, which may be ambiguous, that indicates the octave the pitch is in."}]},"106":{"title":"England_national_football_team","paragraphs":[]},"107":{"title":"Houston","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Who is the current mayor of Houston?","id":"5709517c9928a81400471528","answers":[{"text":"Sylvester Turner","answer_start":302}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What form of government does Houston have?","id":"5709517c9928a81400471529","answers":[{"text":"strong mayoral form of municipal government","answer_start":26}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who are Houston's elected officials?","id":"5709517c9928a8140047152a","answers":[{"text":"the mayor, city controller and 16 members of the Houston City Council","answer_start":199}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does Houston's mayor also serve as?","id":"5709517c9928a8140047152b","answers":[{"text":"the city's chief administrator, executive officer, and official representative","answer_start":390}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Besides the general management of the city, Houston's mayor is also responsible for what?","id":"5709517c9928a8140047152c","answers":[{"text":"seeing that all laws and ordinances are enforced","answer_start":536}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the form of city  government in Houston?","id":"5709c638200fba14003682e1","answers":[{"text":"strong mayoral","answer_start":26}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of municipal elections are held in Texas?","id":"5709c638200fba14003682e2","answers":[{"text":"nonpartisan","answer_start":153}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Besides the mayor and controller, how many members are there on the city council?","id":"5709c638200fba14003682e3","answers":[{"text":"16","answer_start":230}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who is the mayor of Houston since the last election?","id":"5709c638200fba14003682e4","answers":[{"text":"Sylvester Turner","answer_start":302}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"To what political party is Mayor Turner aligned?

It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500\u20134000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. \u00d6tzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300\u20133200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the level of copper in the human body?","id":"57098b07200fba1400368175","answers":[{"text":"1.4 to 2.1 mg per kg of body mass","answer_start":140}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How is copper absorbed in humans?","id":"57098b07200fba1400368176","answers":[{"text":"in the gut","answer_start":302}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is copper bound with when it is sent to the liver?","id":"57098b07200fba1400368177","answers":[{"text":"albumin","answer_start":353}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What protein carries the majority of copper in blood?","id":"57098b07200fba1400368178","answers":[{"text":"Ceruloplasmin","answer_start":556}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How can the body get rid of excess copper?","id":"57098b07200fba1400368179","answers":[{"text":"via bile","answer_start":889}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1.4 to 2.1 mg per kg","answer_start":140}],"question":"What is the level of copper in gold?","id":"5a837151e60761001a2eb711","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"in the gut","answer_start":302}],"question":"How is copper reflected in humans?","id":"5a837151e60761001a2eb712","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"albumin","answer_start":353}],"question":"What is copper bound with when it is sent to the brain?","id":"5a837151e60761001a2eb713","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Ceruloplasmin","answer_start":556}],"question":"What hero carries the majority of copper in blood?","id":"5a837151e60761001a2eb714","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"via bile","answer_start":889}],"question":"How can the sand get rid of excess copper?","id":"5a837151e60761001a2eb715","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Copper is an essential trace element in plants and animals, but not some microorganisms.

Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase. Copper transport here involves the protein ceruloplasmin, which carries the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5 mg a day, vs. about 1 mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine."}]},"109":{"title":"Identity_(social_science)","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Self-image, self-esteem, and individuality relate to what?","id":"5709547eefce8f15003a7e08","answers":[{"text":"A psychological identity","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What aspect or type of identity does Weinreich single out?","id":"5709547eefce8f15003a7e09","answers":[{"text":"ethnic identity","answer_start":497}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What psychological concept does Weinreich state as between the past and future?","id":"5709547eefce8f15003a7e0a","answers":[{"text":"identity","answer_start":169}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"A person's identity is defined as the totality of what?","id":"5709547eefce8f15003a7e0b","answers":[{"text":"one's self-construal","answer_start":208}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"self-image (one's mental model of oneself), self-esteem, and individuality","answer_start":36}],"question":"What does the physical identity relate to?","id":"5a145367c8eab200188dca1f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"One's ethnic identity","answer_start":491}],"question":"What is defined as part of the totality of one's self construal that expresses discord between once construal of past ancestry?","id":"5a145367c8eab200188dca20","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"A psychological identity","answer_start":0}],"question":"What relates to once image of others?","id":"5a145367c8eab200188dca21","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"A person's identity","answer_start":158}],"question":"What is defined as how one aspires to construe oneself in the past and how one construes oneself in the future?","id":"5a145367c8eab200188dca22","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"A psychological identity relates to self-image (one's mental model of oneself), self-esteem, and individuality.

The concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how identity works. In the same way as Barth, in his approach to ethnicity, advocated the critical focus for investigation as being \"the ethnic boundary that defines the group rather than the cultural stuff that it encloses\" (1969:15), social anthropologists such as Cohen and Bray have shifted the focus of analytical study from identity to the boundaries that are used for purposes of identification. If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent, boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built. They concentrated on how the idea of community belonging is differently constructed by individual members and how individuals within the group conceive ethnic boundaries."},{"qas":[{"question":"What are gender identity, ethnic identity, and occupational identity aspects of?","id":"570961b2ed30961900e84036","answers":[{"text":"one's total identity","answer_start":178}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How one construes oneself now and in the future differs considerably because of what 2 things?","id":"570961b2ed30961900e84037","answers":[{"text":"age and accumulated experiences","answer_start":739}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The young child, the adolescent, the young adult and the older adult are phases of what?","id":"570961b2ed30961900e84038","answers":[{"text":"the life cycle","answer_start":415}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The salient experiential markers one uses to define one's past self differ based on the age that one was at what?","id":"570961b2ed30961900e84039","answers":[{"text":"the height of one's powers","answer_start":488}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"gender identity, ethnic identity, occupational identity and so on","answer_start":214}],"question":"What are the parts of one's family identity?","id":"5a146b51c8eab200188dca2f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The inclusiveness of Weinreich's definition","answer_start":0}],"question":"What is directed at the totality of one's identity during all phases and all times?","id":"5a146b51c8eab200188dca30","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"accumulated experiences","answer_start":747}],"question":"What makes how one construes oneself now and in the future similar?","id":"5a146b51c8eab200188dca31","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"life cycle","answer_start":419}],"question":"The phases of what our gender identity, ethnic identity and occupational identity?","id":"5a146b51c8eab200188dca32","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The inclusiveness of Weinreich's definition (above) directs attention to the totality of one's identity at a given phase in time, and assists in elucidating component aspects of one's total identity, such as one's gender identity, ethnic identity, occupational identity and so on.

An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity. But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her. On the other hand, those who do understand the newcomer's language could take it as an inclusive boundary, through which the newcomer associates herself with them to the exclusion of the other people present. Equally, however, it is possible that people who do understand the newcomer but who also speak another language may not want to speak the newcomer's language and so see her marker as an imposition and a negative boundary. It is possible that the newcomer is either aware or unaware of this, depending on whether she herself knows other languages or is conscious of the plurilingual quality of the people there and is respectful of it or not."},{"qas":[{"question":"Various research traditions are using what lens to examine phenomena?","id":"57097697ed30961900e84192","answers":[{"text":"the lens of identity","answer_start":94}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What stigma do correctional officers have to deal with?","id":"57097697ed30961900e84193","answers":[{"text":"glorified maids","answer_start":706}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The implications of identity and identity construction are discussed in what settings?","id":"57097697ed30961900e84194","answers":[{"text":"occupational settings","answer_start":226}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are people in stigmatized jobs forced to create?","id":"57097697ed30961900e84195","answers":[{"text":"an identity they can live with","answer_start":1021}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are the two examples give for justifications and values for occupational choices?","id":"57097697ed30961900e84196","answers":[{"text":"workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life","answer_start":868}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"occupational settings","answer_start":226}],"question":"Where is the implication of identity and identity construction least obvious?","id":"5a14a61aa54d4200185292f5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"identity construction","answer_start":189}],"question":"What becomes increasingly challenging in prestigious jobs?","id":"5a14a61aa54d4200185292f6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"find ways in order to create an identity they can live with","answer_start":992}],"question":"What are people in high-powered forced to do? jobs","id":"5a14a61aa54d4200185292f7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"blaming the client","answer_start":1523}],"question":"What is a desirable alternative to crafting an occupational identity one can live with","id":"5a14a61aa54d4200185292f8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings.

Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). \"The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices.\" Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33). People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with. \"Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered \"dirty\" by societal standards\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 7). \"In other words, doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job. \"If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work, and\/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor, it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33)."},{"qas":[{"question":"What may a person display in terms of both exploration and commitments?","id":"570979bfed30961900e841c0","answers":[{"text":"relative weakness or relative strength","answer_start":28}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the permutation when a person lacks exploration and commitment?","id":"570979bfed30961900e841c1","answers":[{"text":"identity diffusion","answer_start":174}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the permutation when a person has not chosen goals in the past but is willing to in the future?","id":"570979bfed30961900e841c2","answers":[{"text":"identity foreclosure","answer_start":194}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the permutation when a person is ready to make commitments but unable to commit?","id":"570979bfed30961900e841c3","answers":[{"text":"identity moratorium","answer_start":216}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the permutation when a person commits to identity choices?","id":"570979bfed30961900e841c4","answers":[{"text":"identity achievement","answer_start":241}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"exploration and commitments.","answer_start":84}],"question":"What is both relatively weak or relatively strong?","id":"5a148907a54d420018529235","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"identity diffusion","answer_start":174}],"question":"What is the permutation when a person embraces exploration and commitment?","id":"5a148907a54d420018529236","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Moratorium","answer_start":555}],"question":"What is a permutation when a person is not ready to make a commitment?","id":"5a148907a54d420018529237","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"achievement","answer_start":676}],"question":"What is a permutation when a person cannot make an identity choice wants to commit to them?","id":"5a148907a54d420018529238","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"A person may display either relative weakness or relative strength in terms of both exploration and commitments.

Orthodox Judaism holds that, given Jewish law's Divine origin, no underlying principle may be compromised in accounting for changing political, social or economic conditions; in this sense, \"creativity\" and development in Jewish law is limited."},{"qas":[{"question":"When is a newborn boy's hair first cut?","id":"5709840c200fba14003680fd","answers":[{"text":"third birthday","answer_start":293}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is done with the newborn boy's hair once it is cut?","id":"5709840c200fba14003680fe","answers":[{"text":"burned","answer_start":427}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are grains and legumes known as?","id":"5709840c200fba14003680ff","answers":[{"text":"kitniyot","answer_start":604}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of the prohibition against eating grains and legumes during Passover?","id":"5709840c200fba1400368100","answers":[{"text":"Ashkenazi","answer_start":567}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What text rejects the Ashkenazi prohibition against kitniyot?","id":"5709840c200fba1400368101","answers":[{"text":"Talmud","answer_start":720}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"certain customs","answer_start":33}],"question":"What do historians note are continuations of past practices?","id":"5a57ab82770dc0001aeefcc4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"certain customs","answer_start":33}],"question":"What do historians claim are practices of prior generations?","id":"5a57ab82770dc0001aeefcc5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"haredi","answer_start":226}],"question":"Who's tradition is it to cut a boy's hair on his second birthday?","id":"5a57ab82770dc0001aeefcc6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"upshirin or upsheerin","answer_start":309}],"question":"What is the Arabic word for haircut?","id":"5a57ab82770dc0001aeefcc7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Ashkenazi","answer_start":567}],"question":"Who allows the eating of kitniyot?","id":"5a57ab82770dc0001aeefcc8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Jewish historians also note that certain customs of today's Orthodox are not continuations of past practice, but instead represent innovations that would have been unknown to prior generations.

Extroverted people are more likely to be social and express their emotions, while introverted people are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal their emotions.

This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005). Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans (Enard et al. 2002). Speech, language, and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whose work did the theory of Stanley Schachter build on?","id":"570a71734103511400d59712","answers":[{"text":"Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n","answer_start":84}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n inject his patients with?","id":"570a71734103511400d59713","answers":[{"text":"epinephrine","answer_start":129}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the nationality of Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n?","id":"570a71734103511400d59714","answers":[{"text":"Spanish","answer_start":65}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was a notable student of  Stanley Schachter?","id":"570a71734103511400d59715","answers":[{"text":"Jerome Singer","answer_start":1168}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In what year was the book Gut Reactions by Jesse Prinz published?","id":"570a71734103511400d59716","answers":[{"text":"2004","answer_start":1717}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n","answer_start":84}],"question":" Whose work didn't the theory of Stanley Schachter build on?","id":"5ad248ded7d075001a428b7a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"epinephrine","answer_start":129}],"question":" What did Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n not inject his patients with?","id":"5ad248ded7d075001a428b7b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Spanish","answer_start":65}],"question":" What wasn't the nationality of Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n?","id":"5ad248ded7d075001a428b7c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Jerome Singer","answer_start":1168}],"question":" Who was a notable teacher of Stanley Schachter?","id":"5ad248ded7d075001a428b7d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine.

In computer science, affective computing is a branch of the study and development of artificial intelligence that deals with the design of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, and process human emotions. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences, psychology, and cognitive science. While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into emotion, the more modern branch of computer science originated with Rosalind Picard's 1995 paper on affective computing. Detecting emotional information begins with passive sensors which capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. Another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. Emotional speech processing recognizes the user's emotional state by analyzing speech patterns. The detection and processing of facial expression or body gestures is achieved through detectors and sensors."},{"qas":[{"question":"Who argued that emotional responses compete with instinct and reason?","id":"570a7d566d058f1900182eaa","answers":[{"text":"Paul D.

Paul D. MacLean claims that emotion competes with even more instinctive responses, on one hand, and the more abstract reasoning, on the other hand.

It has been estimated that there were around 350 bands active in and around Liverpool in this era, often playing ballrooms, concert halls and clubs, among them the Beatles. After their national success from 1962, a number of Liverpool performers were able to follow them into the charts, including Gerry & the Pacemakers, the Searchers and Cilla Black. The first act to break through in the UK who were not from Liverpool, or managed by Brian Epstein, were Freddie and the Dreamers, who were based in Manchester, as were Herman's Hermits and the Hollies. Led by the Beatles, beat groups from the region spearheaded the British Invasion of the US, which made a major contribution to the development of rock music.

With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the burning of Washington on 25 August 1814, but were repulsed in their Chesapeake Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander killed. The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one-sided military battle that killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers. The winners were the commanding general of the Battle of New Orleans, Major General Andrew Jackson, who became president and the Americans who basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation. The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and Britain never again went to war. The losers were the Indians, who never gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain."}]},"132":{"title":"Hard_rock","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What Aerosmith ballad debuted at number one on the charts?","id":"570b62286b8089140040f906","answers":[{"text":"\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\"","answer_start":343}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the title of AC\/DC's 1995 double lp?","id":"570b62286b8089140040f907","answers":[{"text":"Ballbreaker","answer_start":484}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Bon Jovi's 1995 album was called what?","id":"570b62286b8089140040f908","answers":[{"text":"These Days","answer_start":738}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What commercially successful sub-genre emerged from the grunge movement?","id":"570b62286b8089140040f909","answers":[{"text":"post-grunge","answer_start":1474}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did Aerosmith's album Get A Grip come out?","id":"570b62286b8089140040f90a","answers":[{"text":"1993","answer_start":137}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Get a Grip","answer_start":125}],"question":"What Aerosmith album did not succeed in 1993?

In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC\/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis, including Feeder and Stereophonics, adopted a hard rock or \"pop-metal\" sound."},{"qas":[{"question":"How many copies did Whitesnake's 1987 self title album sell?","id":"570b735dec8fbc190045ba32","answers":[{"text":"17 million","answer_start":116}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the title of Aerosmith's 1987 comeback album?","id":"570b735dec8fbc190045ba33","answers":[{"text":"Permanent Vacation","answer_start":524}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Def Leppard's album Hysteria churned out how many hit singles?","id":"570b735dec8fbc190045ba34","answers":[{"text":"seven","answer_start":901}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What Guns N Roses album was the second best selling debut of all time?","id":"570b735dec8fbc190045ba35","answers":[{"text":"Appetite for Destruction","answer_start":1010}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What Guns N Roses song became a number one single?","id":"570b735dec8fbc190045ba36","answers":[{"text":"\"Sweet Child O' Mine\"","answer_start":1157}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the new commercial climate","answer_start":32}],"question":"What was benefited by the established acts?","id":"5a5a44279c0277001abe70de","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"17 million copies","answer_start":116}],"question":"By how many albums did Deep Purple outsell Witesnake's self-titled album?","id":"5a5a44279c0277001abe70df","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"it was a considerable disappointment","answer_start":409}],"question":"What did Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato call the performance of Deep Purples' song Here I Go Again?","id":"5a5a44279c0277001abe70e0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Girls, Girls, Girls","answer_start":754}],"question":"With what song did Motley Crue reach their commercial peak?","id":"5a5a44279c0277001abe70e1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a hard rock album","answer_start":1896}],"question":"What was number one on the Billboard 200 album charts for 20 consecutive weeks in 1988?","id":"5a5a44279c0277001abe70e2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Established acts benefited from the new commercial climate, with Whitesnake's self-titled album (1987) selling over 17 million copies, outperforming anything in Coverdale's or Deep Purple's catalogue before or since.

The follow-up Slip of the Tongue (1989) went platinum, but according to critics Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato, \"it was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board success of Whitesnake\". Aerosmith's comeback album Permanent Vacation (1987) would begin a decade long revival of their popularity. Crazy Nights (1987) by Kiss was the band's highest charting release in the US since 1979 and the highest of their career in the UK. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce with Girls, Girls, Girls (1987) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria (1987) hit their commercial peak, the latter producing seven hit singles (a record for a hard rock act). Guns N' Roses released the best-selling d\u00e9but of all time, Appetite for Destruction (1987). With a \"grittier\" and \"rawer\" sound than most glam metal, it produced three top 10 hits, including the number one \"Sweet Child O' Mine\". Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s, such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this period with their respective albums Pride (1987) and Long Cold Winter (1988) both going multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles. In the last years of the decade, the most notable successes were New Jersey (1988) by Bon Jovi, OU812 (1988) by Van Halen, Open Up and Say... Ahh! (1988) by Poison, Pump (1989) by Aerosmith, and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's most commercially successful album Dr. Feelgood (1989). New Jersey spawned five Top 10 singles, a record for a hard rock act. In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November, the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks; the albums were OU812, Hysteria, Appetite for Destruction, and New Jersey. A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s, and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s, among them Extreme, Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse. Skid Row also released their eponymous d\u00e9but (1989), reaching number six on the Billboard 200, but they were to be one of the last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era."}]},"133":{"title":"Great_Plains","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"how much of the population have the rural plains lost since 1920?

This problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region.

The continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the Great Plains is not sustainable, and there has been a proposal - the \"Buffalo Commons\" - to return approximately 139,000 square miles (360,000 km2) of these drier parts to native prairie land."}]},"134":{"title":"Infrared","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What is the term for the property that describes how a surface's thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a black body?","id":"570b9002ec8fbc190045ba80","answers":[{"text":"emissivity","answer_start":15}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How will the infrared image of an object with a higher emissivity appear in relation to one with lower emissivity?","id":"570b9002ec8fbc190045ba81","answers":[{"text":"hotter","answer_start":432}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Along with pyrometers, what devices can receive inaccurate results if emissivity is not set correctly?","id":"570b9002ec8fbc190045ba82","answers":[{"text":"infrared cameras","answer_start":585}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"emissivity","answer_start":15}],"question":"What property describes how a surfaces thermal emissions give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers?","id":"5a07d2a20ff9ab00181693dc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"infrared image","answer_start":292}],"question":"What shows the same image of two objects with differing emissivity?","id":"5a07d2a20ff9ab00181693dd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"black body","answer_start":192}],"question":"What ideal shows inaccurate results when using infrared cameras?","id":"5a07d2a20ff9ab00181693de","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"for any pre-set emissivity value, objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter, and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler.","answer_start":355}],"question":"How does pre-set emissivity help infrared cameras give accurate results?","id":"5a07d2a20ff9ab00181693df","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects.","answer_start":0}],"question":"How does comparing two differing objects to a black body give you accurate results?","id":"5a07d2a20ff9ab00181693e0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects.

One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species, and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth.

After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals.

In the previous system, the \"execution score\" was the only score. It was and still is out of 10.00. During the gymnast's performance, the judges deduct this score only. A fall, on or off the event, is a 1.00 deduction, in elite level gymnastics. The introduction of the difficulty score is a significant change. The gymnast's difficulty score is based on what elements they perform and is subject to change if they do not perform or complete all the skills, or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. Connection bonuses are the most common deduction from a difficulty score, as it can be difficult to connect multiple flight elements. It is very hard to connect skills if the first skill is not performed correctly. The new code of points allows the gymnasts to gain higher scores based on the difficulty of the skills they perform as well as their execution.

So believe in Allah (as the One, Unique God), and His Messengers (including Jesus, as Messenger); and do not say: (Allah is one of) a trinity. Give up (this assertion) \u00e2\u20ac\" (it is) for your own good (to do so). Allah is but One Allah ; All-Glorified He is in that He is absolutely above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth.

Melbourne has one of the largest urban footprints in the world due to its low density housing, resulting in a vast suburban sprawl, with a high level of car dependence and minimal public transport outside of inner areas. Much of the vegetation within the city are non-native species, most of European origin, and in many cases plays host to invasive species and noxious weeds. Significant introduced urban pests include the common myna, feral pigeon, brown rat, European wasp, common starling and red fox. Many outlying suburbs, particularly towards the Yarra Valley and the hills to the north-east and east, have gone for extended periods without regenerative fires leading to a lack of saplings and undergrowth in urbanised native bushland. The Department of Sustainability and Environment partially addresses this problem by regularly burning off. Several national parks have been designated around the urban area of Melbourne, including the Mornington Peninsula National Park, Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park and Point Nepean National Park in the south east, Organ Pipes National Park to the north and Dandenong Ranges National Park to the east. There are also a number of significant state parks just outside Melbourne. Responsibility for regulating pollution falls under the jurisdiction of the EPA Victoria and several local councils.

Richard appears to have started to recognise John as his heir presumptive in the final years before his death, but the matter was not clear-cut and medieval law gave little guidance as to how the competing claims should be decided. With Norman law favouring John as the only surviving son of Henry II and Angevin law favouring Arthur as the only son of Henry's elder son, the matter rapidly became an open conflict. John was supported by the bulk of the English and Norman nobility and was crowned at Westminster, backed by his mother, Eleanor. Arthur was supported by the majority of the Breton, Maine and Anjou nobles and received the support of Philip II, who remained committed to breaking up the Angevin territories on the continent.

Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went to Paris, where he formed an alliance with Philip. He agreed to set aside his wife, Isabella of Gloucester, and marry Philip's sister, Alys, in exchange for Philip's support. Fighting broke out in England between forces loyal to Richard and those being gathered by John. John's military position was weak and he agreed to a truce; in early 1194 the king finally returned to England, and John's remaining forces surrendered. John retreated to Normandy, where Richard finally found him later that year. Richard declared that his younger brother \u2013 despite being 27 years old \u2013 was merely \"a child who has had evil counsellors\" and forgave him, but removed his lands with the exception of Ireland."},{"qas":[{"question":"John moved south into where?","id":"570c54efb3d812140066d121","answers":[{"text":"France","answer_start":44}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who renewed the anti-French alliances?","id":"570c54efb3d812140066d122","answers":[{"text":"Baldwin IX of Flanders and Renaud of Boulogne","answer_start":299}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was the Treaty of Le Goulet negotiated?","id":"570c54efb3d812140066d123","answers":[{"text":"May 1200","answer_start":971}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What nickname did John's policy earn him?","id":"570c54efb3d812140066d124","answers":[{"text":"John Softsword","answer_start":1437}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"After his coronation, John moved south into France with military forces and adopted a defensive posture along the eastern and southern Normandy borders.

The powerful Anjou nobleman William des Roches was persuaded to switch sides from Arthur to John; suddenly the balance seemed to be tipping away from Philip and Arthur in favour of John. Neither side was keen to continue the conflict, and following a papal truce the two leaders met in January 1200 to negotiate possible terms for peace. From John's perspective, what then followed represented an opportunity to stabilise control over his continental possessions and produce a lasting peace with Philip in Paris. John and Philip negotiated the May 1200 Treaty of Le Goulet; by this treaty, Philip recognised John as the rightful heir to Richard in respect to his French possessions, temporarily abandoning the wider claims of his client, Arthur.[nb 4] John, in turn, abandoned Richard's former policy of containing Philip through alliances with Flanders and Boulogne, and accepted Philip's right as the legitimate feudal overlord of John's lands in France.

Several new processes had been introduced to English law under Henry II, including novel disseisin and mort d'ancestor. These processes meant the royal courts had a more significant role in local law cases, which had previously been dealt with only by regional or local lords. John increased the professionalism of local sergeants and bailiffs, and extended the system of coroners first introduced by Hubert Walter in 1194, creating a new class of borough coroners. John worked extremely hard to ensure that this system operated well, through judges he had appointed, by fostering legal specialists and expertise, and by intervening in cases himself. John continued to try relatively minor cases, even during military crises. Viewed positively, Lewis Warren considers that John discharged \"his royal duty of providing justice ... with a zeal and a tirelessness to which the English common law is greatly endebted\". Seen more critically, John may have been motivated by the potential of the royal legal process to raise fees, rather than a desire to deliver simple justice; John's legal system also only applied to free men, rather than to all of the population. Nonetheless, these changes were popular with many free tenants, who acquired a more reliable legal system that could bypass the barons, against whom such cases were often brought. John's reforms were less popular with the barons themselves, especially as they remained subject to arbitrary and frequently vindictive royal justice."},{"qas":[{"question":"When did new interpretations of John's reign begin to emerge?","id":"570c578fb3d812140066d163","answers":[{"text":"1940s","answer_start":7}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who wrote an essay in 1945 that proposed a \"new approach?\"","id":"570c578fb3d812140066d164","answers":[{"text":"Vivian Galbraith","answer_start":220}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who suggested that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than previously supposed?","id":"570c578fb3d812140066d165","answers":[{"text":"Lewis Warren","answer_start":1104}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"In the 1940s, new interpretations of John's reign began to emerge, based on research into the record evidence of his reign, such as pipe rolls, charters, court documents and similar primary records.

The use of recorded evidence was combined with an increased scepticism about two of the most colourful chroniclers of John's reign, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. In many cases the detail provided by these chroniclers, both writing after John's death, was challenged by modern historians. Interpretations of Magna Carta and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been significantly revised: although the charter's symbolic, constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable, in the context of John's reign most historians now consider it a failed peace agreement between \"partisan\" factions.

He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent excommunicated the king in November 1209. Although theoretically a significant blow to John's legitimacy, this did not appear to greatly worry the king. Two of John's close allies, Emperor Otto IV and Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, had already suffered the same punishment themselves, and the significance of excommunication had been somewhat devalued. John simply tightened his existing measures and accrued significant sums from the income of vacant sees and abbeys: one 1213 estimate, for example, suggested the church had lost an estimated 100,000 marks (equivalent to \u00a366,666 at the time) to John.

Scott's work influenced the late 19th-century children's writer Howard Pyle's book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, which in turn established John as the principal villain within the traditional Robin Hood narrative. During the 20th century, John was normally depicted in fictional books and films alongside Robin Hood. Sam De Grasse's role as John in the black-and-white 1922 film version shows John committing numerous atrocities and acts of torture. Claude Rains played John in the 1938 colour version alongside Errol Flynn, starting a trend for films to depict John as an \"effeminate ... arrogant and cowardly stay-at-home\". The character of John acts either to highlight the virtues of King Richard, or contrasts with the Sheriff of Nottingham, who is usually the \"swashbuckling villain\" opposing Robin. An extreme version of this trend can be seen in the Disney cartoon version, for example, which depicts John, voiced by Peter Ustinov, as a \"cowardly, thumbsucking lion\". Popular works that depict John beyond the Robin Hood legends, such as James Goldman's play and later film, The Lion in Winter, set in 1183, commonly present him as an \"effete weakling\", in this instance contrasted with the more masculine Henry II, or as a tyrant, as in A.

By contrast, Shakespeare's King John, a relatively anti-Catholic play that draws on The Troublesome Reign for its source material, offers a more \"balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome's machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler\". Anthony Munday's play The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington portrays many of John's negative traits, but adopts a positive interpretation of the king's stand against the Roman Catholic Church, in line with the contemporary views of the Tudor monarchs.

John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb 9] John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not just a personal blow for John, but threatened to unravel the widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France. Philip moved south around the new defensive line and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy, now facing little resistance.

John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John.

One group was the familiares regis, John's immediate friends and knights who travelled around the country with him. They also played an important role in organising and leading military campaigns. Another section of royal followers were the curia regis; these curiales were the senior officials and agents of the king and were essential to his day-to-day rule. Being a member of these inner circles brought huge advantages, as it was easier to gain favours from the king, file lawsuits, marry a wealthy heiress or have one's debts remitted. By the time of Henry II, these posts were increasingly being filled by \"new men\" from outside the normal ranks of the barons. This intensified under John's rule, with many lesser nobles arriving from the continent to take up positions at court; many were mercenary leaders from Poitou. These men included soldiers who would become infamous in England for their uncivilised behaviour, including Falkes de Breaut\u00e9, Geard d'Athies, Engelard de Cigong\u00e9 and Philip Marc. Many barons perceived the king's household as what Ralph Turner has characterised as a \"narrow clique enjoying royal favour at barons' expense\" staffed by men of lesser status."},{"qas":[{"question":"Historians suspected that John was at best what?","id":"570c6868b3d812140066d1db","answers":[{"text":"impious","answer_start":144}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was later declared a saint?","id":"570c6868b3d812140066d1dc","answers":[{"text":"Hugh of Lincoln","answer_start":953}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Many records showed what?","id":"570c6868b3d812140066d1dd","answers":[{"text":"John's offerings to the poor","answer_start":1135}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"John's lack of religious conviction has been noted by contemporary chroniclers and later historians, with some suspecting that John was at best impious, or even atheistic, a very serious issue at the time. Contemporary chroniclers catalogued his various anti-religious habits at length, including his failure to take communion, his blasphemous remarks, and his witty but scandalous jokes about church doctrine, including jokes about the implausibility of the Resurrection. They commented on the paucity of John's charitable donations to the church. Historian Frank McLynn argues that John's early years at Fontevrault, combined with his relatively advanced education, may have turned him against the church. Other historians have been more cautious in interpreting this material, noting that chroniclers also reported John's personal interest in the life of St Wulfstan of Worcester and his friendships with several senior clerics, most especially with Hugh of Lincoln, who was later declared a saint. Financial records show a normal royal household engaged in the usual feasts and pious observances \u2013 albeit with many records showing John's offerings to the poor to atone for routinely breaking church rules and guidance. The historian Lewis Warren has argued that the chronicler accounts were subject to considerable bias and the King was \"at least conventionally devout,\" citing his pilgrimages and interest in religious scripture and commentaries."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where did many of the disaffected barons come from?","id":"570c695efed7b91900d459bf","answers":[{"text":"north of England","answer_start":169}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was appointed justiciar?","id":"570c695efed7b91900d459c0","answers":[{"text":"Peter des Roches","answer_start":855}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the final straw that precipitated the baronial uprising during John's final years as king?","id":"570c695efed7b91900d459c1","answers":[{"text":"The failure of John's French military campaign","answer_start":978}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Tensions between John and the barons had been growing for several years, as demonstrated by the 1212 plot against the king. Many of the disaffected barons came from the north of England; that faction was often labelled by contemporaries and historians as \"the Northerners\". The northern barons rarely had any personal stake in the conflict in France, and many of them owed large sums of money to John; the revolt has been characterised as \"a rebellion of the king's debtors\". Many of John's military household joined the rebels, particularly amongst those that John had appointed to administrative roles across England; their local links and loyalties outweighed their personal loyalty to John. Tension also grew across North Wales, where opposition to the 1211 treaty between John and Llywelyn was turning into open conflict. For some the appointment of Peter des Roches as justiciar was an important factor, as he was considered an \"abrasive foreigner\" by many of the barons. The failure of John's French military campaign in 1214 was probably the final straw that precipitated the baronial uprising during John's final years as king; James Holt describes the path to civil war as \"direct, short and unavoidable\" following the defeat at Bouvines."},{"qas":[{"question":"What biographers argue that John was an unsuccessful monarch?","id":"570c6b74fed7b91900d459cb","answers":[{"text":"Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren","answer_start":59}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Modern historians have been over lenient towards what?","id":"570c6b74fed7b91900d459cc","answers":[{"text":"John's numerous faults","answer_start":807}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"John Gillingham considers John what?","id":"570c6b74fed7b91900d459cd","answers":[{"text":"a less effective general","answer_start":574}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Most historians today, including John's recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren, argue that John was an unsuccessful monarch, but note that his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th-century chroniclers.

John Gillingham, author of a major biography of Richard I, follows this line too, although he considers John a less effective general than do Turner or Warren, and describes him \"one of the worst kings ever to rule England\". Bradbury takes a moderate line, but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards John's numerous faults.

Bud Tribble, a member of the Mac team, was interested in running the Apple Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh, and asked Smith whether he could incorporate the Lisa's Motorola 68000 microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost down.

Smith's design used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made production of the board significantly more cost-efficient.

The decision caused significant financial losses for companies like Motorola, who produced the StarMax; Umax, who produced the SuperMac; and Power Computing, who offered several lines of Mac clones, including the PowerWave, PowerTower, and PowerTower Pro. These companies had invested substantial resources in creating their own Mac-compatible hardware. Apple bought out Power Computing's license, but allowed Umax to continue selling Mac clones until their license expired, as they had a sizeable presence in the lower-end segment that Apple did not. In September 1997 Apple extended Umax' license allowing them to sell clones with Mac OS 8, the only clone maker to do so, but with the restriction that they only sell low-end systems. Without the higher profit margins of high-end systems, however, Umax judged this would not be profitable and exited the Mac clone market in May 1998, having lost USD$36 million on the program."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the only mainstream computer platform to successfully transition to a new CPU architecture?","id":"570ce659fed7b91900d45aa1","answers":[{"text":"Macintosh","answer_start":241}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the standard amount of RAM included with almost all current Mac models?","id":"570ce659fed7b91900d45aa2","answers":[{"text":"8 GB","answer_start":418}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which MacBook Pro port can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second?","id":"570ce659fed7b91900d45aa3","answers":[{"text":"Thunderbolt","answer_start":1084}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was the iMac G5 released?","id":"570ce659fed7b91900d45aa4","answers":[{"text":"October 2005","answer_start":1391}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which interface did Apple introduce that was capable of being operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer?","id":"570ce659fed7b91900d45aa5","answers":[{"text":"Front Row","answer_start":1513}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the standard amount of RAM shipped with most Mac models?","id":"570d3c29b3d812140066d5b0","answers":[{"text":"8 GB","answer_start":418}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What processors are used by the current Mac product family?","id":"570d3c29b3d812140066d5b1","answers":[{"text":"Intel x86-64","answer_start":36}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many data transfer ports are included in most current Macs?","id":"570d3c29b3d812140066d5b2","answers":[{"text":"two","answer_start":864}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"According to Apple, how fast can the Thunderbolt port transfer data?","id":"570d3c29b3d812140066d5b3","answers":[{"text":"up to 10 gigabits per second.","answer_start":1148}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Macintosh","answer_start":241}],"question":"What is the only mainstream computer platform to unsuccessfully transition to a new CPU architecture?","id":"5ad561af5b96ef001a10ad32","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"8 GB","answer_start":418}],"question":"What is the standard amount of ROM included with almost all current Mac models?","id":"5ad561af5b96ef001a10ad33","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Thunderbolt","answer_start":906}],"question":"Which MacBook Pro port can transfer data at speeds up to 20 gigabits per second?","id":"5ad561af5b96ef001a10ad34","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"October 2005","answer_start":1391}],"question":"When was the iMac G6 released?","id":"5ad561af5b96ef001a10ad35","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Front Row","answer_start":1513}],"question":"Which interface did Apple introduce that was capable of being operated by an Microsoft Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer?","id":"5ad561af5b96ef001a10ad36","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The current Mac product family uses Intel x86-64 processors.

Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over $1,000.

Team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs' ideas than Raskin's. After hearing of the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC, Jobs had negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and its Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options. The Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at Xerox PARC and were combined with the Macintosh group's own ideas. Jobs also commissioned industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger to work on the Macintosh line, resulting in the \"Snow White\" design language; although it came too late for the earliest Macs, it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers. However, Jobs' leadership at the Macintosh project did not last; after an internal power struggle with new CEO John Sculley, Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985.

Spanish is official in all of Spain, whereas Valencian is official in the Valencian Country, as well as in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, where it receives the name of Catalan. Despite the differentiated denomination, the distinct dialectal traits and political tension between Catalonia and the Valencian Country, Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible and are considered two varieties of the same language.\nValencian has been historically repressed in favour of Spanish. The effects have been more noticeable in the city proper, whereas the language has remained active in the rural and metropolitan areas. After the Castille-Aragon unification, a Spanish-speaking elite established itself in the city. In more recent history, the establishment of Franco's military and administrative apparatus in Valencia further excluded Valencian from public life. Valencian recovered its official status, prestige and use in education after the transition to democracy in 1978. However, due to industrialisation in recent decades, Valencia has attracted immigration from other regions in Spain, and hence there is also a demographic factor for its declining social use. Due to a combination of these reasons, Valencia has become the bastion of anti-Catalan blaverism, which celebrates Valencian as merely folkloric, but rejects the existing standard which was adapted from Catalan orthography.\nSpanish is currently the predominant language in the city proper but, thanks to the education system, most Valencians have basic knowledge of both Spanish and Valencian, and either can be used in the city. Valencia is therefore the second biggest Catalan-speaking city after Barcelona. Institutional buildings and streets are named in Valencian. The city is also home to many pro-Valencian political and civil organisations. Furthermore, education entirely in Valencian is offered in more than 70 state-owned schools in the city, as well as by the University of Valencia across all disciplines."},{"qas":[{"question":"When was the dome built?","id":"570d4d9efed7b91900d45e4d","answers":[{"text":"15th century","answer_start":7}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who started the construction of the main chapel?","id":"570d4d9efed7b91900d45e4e","answers":[{"text":"Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros","answer_start":144}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was the main entrance constructed?","id":"570d4d9efed7b91900d45e4f","answers":[{"text":"beginning of the 18th century","answer_start":324}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In what style is the door of the Apostles?","id":"570d4d9efed7b91900d45e50","answers":[{"text":"Gothic","answer_start":507}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who painted the pictures that are in the San Francesco chapel?","id":"570d4d9efed7b91900d45e51","answers":[{"text":"Francisco Goya","answer_start":1220}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"In the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance.

The Institute was instrumental in initiating studies of healthy development, in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities. The studies looked at human development during the Great Depression and World War II, unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up. The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development of children in the Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood. Jean Macfarlane launched the Berkeley Guidance Study, which examined the development of children in terms of their socioeconomic and family backgrounds. These studies provided the background for Glen Elder in the 1960s, to propose a life-course perspective of adolescent development. Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part; and the principle of human agency asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is a male's major landmark of puberty?","id":"570d7b4db3d812140066d9cb","answers":[{"text":"first ejaculation","answer_start":47}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"At what average age does a male's first ejaculation occur?","id":"570d7b4db3d812140066d9cc","answers":[{"text":"13","answer_start":99}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is a female's major landmark of puberty?","id":"570d7b4db3d812140066d9cd","answers":[{"text":"menstruation","answer_start":145}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Besides heredity, what other factors contribute to when menustration begins?","id":"570d7b4db3d812140066d9ce","answers":[{"text":"diet and lifestyle","answer_start":269}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Do girls who are malnourished start menustrating earlier or later than those with high-fat diets?","id":"570d7b4db3d812140066d9cf","answers":[{"text":"later","answer_start":777}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"The major landmark of puberty for males is the first ejaculation, which occurs, on average, at age 13.

When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent\u2013child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites in the first place and this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent\u2013adolescent relationship is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks. Although conflicts between children and parents increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues.

For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also plays an important role in their identity development. Studies done by the American Psychological Association have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which theorist argued that not everyone fully achieves identity?","id":"570da8e2df2f5219002ed0ce","answers":[{"text":"Erik Erikson","answer_start":332}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How do adolescents initially define themselves?","id":"570da8e2df2f5219002ed0cf","answers":[{"text":"crowd membership","answer_start":852}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How is Moratorium defined?","id":"570da8e2df2f5219002ed0d0","answers":[{"text":"process of exploration","answer_start":2330}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which researcher developed the current method for testing an individual's process along the stages of identity?","id":"570da8e2df2f5219002ed0d1","answers":[{"text":"James Marcia","answer_start":1786}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"James Marcia divides questions into how many categories?","id":"570da8e2df2f5219002ed0d2","answers":[{"text":"three","answer_start":1916}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. \"Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards.\" This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia developed the current method for testing an individual's progress along these stages. His questions are divided into three categories: occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments. The result is classification of the individual into a) identity diffusion in which all children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure in which commitments are made without the exploration of alternatives, c) Moratorium, or the process of exploration, or d) Identity Achievement in which Moratorium has occurred and resulted in commitments."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which term is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity?","id":"570da9c916d0071400510c71","answers":[{"text":"Self-esteem","answer_start":61}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Is there evidence to support a drop in self-esteem during adolescence?","id":"570da9c916d0071400510c72","answers":[{"text":"no","answer_start":337}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which type of self-esteem fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety?","id":"570da9c916d0071400510c73","answers":[{"text":"Barometric self-esteem","answer_start":430}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which type of self-esteem remains stable throughout adolescence?","id":"570da9c916d0071400510c74","answers":[{"text":"baseline self-esteem","answer_start":520}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the most important function of friendship?","id":"570da9c916d0071400510c75","answers":[{"text":"having someone who can provide social and moral support","answer_start":896}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995)."},{"qas":[{"question":"How is culture defined?","id":"570db44716d0071400510d09","answers":[{"text":"symbolic and behavioral inheritance received from the past that provides a community framework for what is valued","answer_start":172}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Does culture affect all, some, or none of the aspects of an individual's life?","id":"570db44716d0071400510d0a","answers":[{"text":"all","answer_start":343}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is a challenge researchers face when studying culture and adolescents?","id":"570db44716d0071400510d0b","answers":[{"text":"not to define the culture's role in adolescence in terms of their own cultural beliefs","answer_start":1157}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Should culture be directly connected to a nation or ethnicity?","id":"570db44716d0071400510d0c","answers":[{"text":"not","answer_start":954}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"There are certain characteristics of adolescent development that are more rooted in culture than in human biology or cognitive structures.

It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century.

This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development.

Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. \"The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and, ... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons).\" This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one\u2019s identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one\u2019s development.

Cognitive autonomy describes the capacity for an adolescent to partake in processes of independent reasoning and decision-making without excessive reliance on social validation. Converging influences from adolescent cognitive development, expanding social relationships, an increasingly adultlike appearance, and the acceptance of more rights and responsibilities enhance feelings of autonomy for adolescents.

In this stage, the youth is overwhelmed by feelings of inner turmoil regarding their sexual orientation, and begins to engage sexual experiences with same-sex partners.

This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 \u00b0C (0.2 \u00b0F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there."}]},"153":{"title":"Eritrea","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Which part of Eritrea's health care goals have they been most successful in?","id":"570e24420b85d914000d7ceb","answers":[{"text":"child health","answer_start":188}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the Eritrean life expectancy at birth in 1960?","id":"570e24420b85d914000d7cec","answers":[{"text":"39.1","answer_start":246}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the Eritrean life expectancy st birth in 2008?","id":"570e24420b85d914000d7ced","answers":[{"text":"59.5","answer_start":262}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which practice was banned by the Eritrean government with claimes it is painful and has life-threatening health problems for women?","id":"570e24420b85d914000d7cee","answers":[{"text":"female genital mutilation","answer_start":1172}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much did the National Malaria Protection Unit reduce malarial mortality by from 1998 - 2006?","id":"570e24420b85d914000d7cef","answers":[{"text":"85%","answer_start":1079}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"2006","answer_start":1131}],"question":"In what year was female genital mutilation banned in Eretria?","id":"5ad0d32d645df0001a2d0576","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"78.5%","answer_start":810}],"question":"How many kids had been vaccinated against measles in 2008?","id":"5ad0d32d645df0001a2d0577","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"59.5","answer_start":262}],"question":"What was the life expectancy in 2006 in Eretria?","id":"5ad0d32d645df0001a2d0578","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"2002","answer_start":887}],"question":"In what year was the Millenium Development Goal targets put in place?","id":"5ad0d32d645df0001a2d0579","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1960","answer_start":254}],"question":"When was the World Health Organisation established?","id":"5ad0d32d645df0001a2d057a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Eritrea has achieved significant improvements in health care and is one of the few countries to be on target to meet its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets in health, in particular child health.

Thus, the fact that women are aroused by seeing non-human primates having sex does not mean that women's sexual orientation includes this type of sexual interest. Some researchers argue that women's sexual orientation depends less on their patterns of sexual arousal than men's and that other components of sexual orientation (like emotional attachment) must be taken into account when describing women's sexual orientations. In contrast, men's sexual orientations tend to be primarily focused on the physical component of attractions and, thus, their sexual feelings are more exclusively oriented according to sex."}]},"159":{"title":"Dell","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What decade did Dell begin to sell things other than PCs?","id":"570fcb315ab6b81900390fff","answers":[{"text":"1990s","answer_start":11}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq were the major providers of what?","id":"570fcb315ab6b81900391000","answers":[{"text":"servers","answer_start":149}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What servers did Dell create that they tried to break into the market with?","id":"570fcb315ab6b81900391001","answers":[{"text":"PowerEdge","answer_start":370}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What year did Dell's enterprise revenue make up a large chunk of its profit?","id":"570fcb315ab6b81900391002","answers":[{"text":"1998","answer_start":678}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which company did Dell exceed as a server provider?","id":"570fcb315ab6b81900391003","answers":[{"text":"Compaq","answer_start":715}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"mid-1990s","answer_start":7}],"question":"What decade did Dell begin to buy things other than PCs?","id":"5ad35a39604f3c001a3fde55","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"servers","answer_start":149}],"question":"IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq were the minor providers of what?","id":"5ad35a39604f3c001a3fde56","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"PowerEdge","answer_start":370}],"question":"What servers did Dell destroy that they tried to break into the market with?","id":"5ad35a39604f3c001a3fde57","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1998","answer_start":678}],"question":"What year did Dell's enterprise revenue make up a large chunk of its loss?","id":"5ad35a39604f3c001a3fde58","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Compaq","answer_start":715}],"question":"Which company did Dell lag behind of as a server provider?","id":"5ad35a39604f3c001a3fde59","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers.

Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its competitors. Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31 percent of the market. Dell's first acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition."},{"qas":[{"question":"What market made up the majority of Dell's sales?","id":"570fcc155ab6b81900391009","answers":[{"text":"PC","answer_start":61}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What advantage did Dell hold in the PC market?","id":"570fcc155ab6b8190039100a","answers":[{"text":"price","answer_start":245}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What operation did Hewlett Packard and Acer make more efficient to compete with Dell?","id":"570fcc155ab6b8190039100b","answers":[{"text":"manufacturing","answer_start":484}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where did Dell miss out on sales due to relying on the internet?","id":"570fcc155ab6b8190039100c","answers":[{"text":"big box stores","answer_start":1253}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What company stated that Dell was preventing itself from innovating?","id":"570fcc155ab6b8190039100d","answers":[{"text":"CNET","answer_start":1269}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"PC","answer_start":61}],"question":"What market made up the minority of Dell's sales?","id":"5ad35add604f3c001a3fde69","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"price","answer_start":245}],"question":"What disadvantage did Dell hold in the PC market?","id":"5ad35add604f3c001a3fde6a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"manufacturing","answer_start":484}],"question":"What operation did Hewlett Packard and Acer make more inefficient to compete with Dell?","id":"5ad35add604f3c001a3fde6b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"big box stores","answer_start":1253}],"question":"Where didn't Dell miss out on sales due to relying on the internet?","id":"5ad35add604f3c001a3fde6c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"CNET","answer_start":1269}],"question":"What company stated that IBM was preventing itself from innovating?","id":"5ad35add604f3c001a3fde6d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs, but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation. Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers (a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory). As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market, but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell's manufacturing cost advantages, plus Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores.

Elliott argued this structure deeply undervalued EMC's core \"EMC II\" data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies. The Wall Street Journal estimated that in 2014 Dell had revenue of $27.3 billion from personal computers and $8.9bn from servers, while EMC had $16.5bn from EMC II, $1bn from RSA Security, $6bn from VMware, and $230 million from Pivotal Software.

Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand. If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he\/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible.

Yet, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final. Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, the first step in collateral review is state collateral review. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state. Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review. Most often these are claims, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review. In 2010, the death sentences of 53 inmates were overturned as a result of legal appeals or high court reversals."},{"qas":[{"question":"In what case did the Supreme Court allow Section 1983 to be used to challenge a method of execution?","id":"570ffb75b654c5140001f711","answers":[{"text":"Hill v.

In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit.

The authors found that prosecutors' capital punishment filing decisions remain marked by local \"idiosyncrasies,\" suggesting they are not in keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court's directive. This means that \"the very types of unfairness that the Supreme Court sought to eliminate\" may still \"infect capital cases.\" Wide prosecutorial discretion remains because of overly broad criteria. California law, for example, has 22 \"special circumstances,\" making nearly all premeditated murders potential capital cases. The 32 death penalty states have varying numbers and types of \"death qualifiers\" \u2013 circumstances that allow for capital charges. The number varies from a high of 34 in California to 22 in Colorado and Delaware to 12 in Texas, Nebraska, Georgia and Montana. The study's authors call for reform of state procedures along the lines of reforms in the federal system, which the U.S. Department of Justice initiated with a 1995 protocol. Crimes subject to the death penalty vary by jurisdiction. All jurisdictions that use capital punishment designate the highest grade of murder a capital crime, although most jurisdictions require aggravating circumstances. Treason against the United States, as well as treason against the states of Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri are capital offenses."}]},"161":{"title":"Age_of_Enlightenment","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"How does John Locke define mutual security?","id":"57104598b654c5140001f8c1","answers":[{"text":"the idea that one cannot infringe on another's natural rights","answer_start":435}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What do Locke's idea of natural rights include?","id":"57104598b654c5140001f8c2","answers":[{"text":"perfect equality and freedom, and the right to preserve life and property","answer_start":586}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Why did John Locke believe that one person cannot enslave another?","id":"57104598b654c5140001f8c3","answers":[{"text":"because it is morally reprehensible","answer_start":926}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was John Locke's one exception to denouncing slavery?","id":"57104598b654c5140001f8c4","answers":[{"text":"enslavement of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one's natural rights","answer_start":1010}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which of John Locke's works are natural rights most famously defined and discussed?","id":"57104598b654c5140001f8c5","answers":[{"text":"Second Treatise","answer_start":315}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Both Rousseau and Locke's social contract theories rest on the presupposition of natural rights, which are not a result of law or custom, but are things that all men have in pre-political societies, and are therefore universal and inalienable.

For Locke the law of nature is grounded on mutual security, or the idea that one cannot infringe on another's natural rights, as every man is equal and has the same inalienable rights. These natural rights include perfect equality and freedom, and the right to preserve life and property. Locke also argued against slavery on the basis that enslaving yourself goes against the law of nature; you cannot surrender your own rights, your freedom is absolute and no one can take it from you.

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647\u20131706) observed that in his day, \"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\"."},{"qas":[{"question":"According to German historian Reinhart Koselleck, which two social structures left a decisive imprint on the Age of Enlightenment?","id":"571101b2b654c5140001fa9d","answers":[{"text":"the Republic of Letters and the Masonic lodges","answer_start":158}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which Scottish professor believes that Masons were not a major radical or reformist network in their own right?","id":"571101b2b654c5140001fa9e","answers":[{"text":"Thomas Munck","answer_start":226}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Historian Margaret Jacob stresses the importance of the Masons in indirectly inspriting what type of thinking?","id":"571101b2b654c5140001fa9f","answers":[{"text":"political thought","answer_start":849}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Daniel Roche claims that Masonry promoted what idea by only attracting men of similar social background?","id":"571101b2b654c5140001faa0","answers":[{"text":"egalitarianism","answer_start":941}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The presence of whom in the French \"lodges of adoption\" formed in the 1780s was die to the close ties shared with aristocratic society?","id":"571101b2b654c5140001faa1","answers":[{"text":"noble women","answer_start":1049}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"German historian Reinhart Koselleck claimed that \"On the Continent there were two social structures that left a decisive imprint on the Age of Enlightenment: the Republic of Letters and the Masonic lodges.\" Scottish professor Thomas Munck argues that \"although the Masons did promote international and cross-social contacts which were essentially non-religious and broadly in agreement with enlightened values, they can hardly be described as a major radical or reformist network in their own right.\" Many of the Masons values seemed to greatly appeal to Enlightenment values and thinkers.

Nintendo's intention, however, was to reserve a large part of NES game revenue for itself. Nintendo required that they be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges, and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced. Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the risk. As a result, some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games. Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges, it was able to enforce strict rules on its third-party developers, which were required to sign a contract by Nintendo that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system, order at least 10,000 cartridges, and only make five games per year. A 1988 shortage of DRAM and ROM chips also reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit 25% of publishers' requests for cartridges. This was an average figure, with some publishers receiving much higher amounts and others almost none. GameSpy noted that Nintendo's \"iron-clad terms\" made the company many enemies during the 1980s.

Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo\u2019s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing."}]},"163":{"title":"Athanasius_of_Alexandria","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where is Gaul currently located?","id":"571aa5df10f8ca1400305259","answers":[{"text":"Belgium \/ Holland and surrounding areas","answer_start":115}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"With whom did Athanasius travel to Sardica?","id":"571aa5df10f8ca140030525a","answers":[{"text":"Hosius of Cordoba","answer_start":162}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"About what did the Council of the Church question Athanasius?","id":"571aa5df10f8ca140030525b","answers":[{"text":"misdemeanours and even murder","answer_start":577}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Was Athanasius permitted admission to the Council?","id":"571aa5df10f8ca140030525c","answers":[{"text":"objections were overridden by the orthodox bishops","answer_start":1289}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the verdict at the Council of Sardica?","id":"571aa5df10f8ca140030525d","answers":[{"text":"his innocence reaffirmed","answer_start":1713}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Belgium","answer_start":115}],"question":"Where is Gaul not currently located?","id":"5aceb9df32bba1001ae4b1e3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Hosius of Cordoba","answer_start":162}],"question":" With whom did Athanasius travel to Africa?","id":"5aceb9df32bba1001ae4b1e4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"misdemeanours","answer_start":577}],"question":" About what did the Council of the Church question Julius?","id":"5aceb9df32bba1001ae4b1e5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Athanasius","answer_start":2324}],"question":"Who was found guilty?","id":"5aceb9df32bba1001ae4b1e6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Early in the year 343 we find Athanasius had travelled, via Rome, from Alexandria, North Africa, to Gaul; nowadays Belgium \/ Holland and surrounding areas, where Hosius of Cordoba was Bishop, the great champion of orthodoxy in the West. The two, together, set out for Sardica. A full Council of the Church was convened \/ summoned there in deference to the Roman pontiff's wishes. The travel was a mammoth task in itself. At this great gathering of prelates, leaders of the Church, the case of Athanasius was taken up once more, that is, Athanasius was formally questioned over misdemeanours and even murder, (a man called Arsenius and using his body for magic, \u2013 an absurd charge.). [The Council was convoked for the purpose of inquiring into the charges against Athanasius and other bishops, on account of which they were deposed from their sees by the Semi-Arian Synod of Antioch (341), and went into exile. It was called according to Socrates, (E. H. ii. 20) by the two Emperors, Constans and Constantius; but, according to Baronius by Pope Julius (337\u2013352), (Ad an. 343). One hundred and seventy six attended. Eusebian bishops objected to the admission of Athanasius and other deposed bishops to the Council, except as accused persons to answer the charges brought against them. Their objections were overridden by the orthodox bishops, about a hundred were orthodox, who were the majority. The Eusebians, seeing they had no chance of having their views carried, retired to Philoppopolis in Thrace, Philippopolis (Thracia), where they held an opposition council, under the presidency of the Patriarch of Antioch, and confirmed the decrees of the Synod of Antioch. ]. Once more, at the Council of Sardica, was his innocence reaffirmed. Two conciliar letters were prepared, one to the clergy and faithful of Alexandria, the other to the bishops of Egypt and Libya, in which the will of the Council was made known. Meanwhile, the Eusebian party had gone to Philippopolis, where they issued an anathema against Athanasius and his supporters. The persecution against the orthodox party broke out with renewed vigour, and Constantius was induced to prepare drastic measures against Athanasius and the priests who were devoted to him. Orders were given that if the Saint attempt to re-enter his see, he should be put to death. Athanasius, accordingly, withdrew from Sardica to Naissus in Mysia, where he celebrated the Easter festival of the year 344. It was Hosius who presided over the Council of Sardica, as he did for the First Council of Nicaea, which like the 341 synod, found Athanasius innocent. &.

This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. Hippocampal damage may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage.

Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time. Episodic memories often reflect the \"firsts\" in life such as a first kiss, first day of school or first time winning a championship. These are key events in one's life that can be remembered clearly. Autobiographical memory - memory for particular events within one's own life - is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. Visual memory is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a mental image. Visual memory can result in priming and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"What can cause your memory to deterioriate or not work as well?","id":"571a711910f8ca1400305037","answers":[{"text":"Stress","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which hormones are produces when a animal is stressed out?","id":"571a711910f8ca1400305038","answers":[{"text":"adrenal hormones","answer_start":320}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who performed a study that involved having peoples hands in cold water while also memorizing words?","id":"571a711910f8ca1400305039","answers":[{"text":"L.

In response to stressful situations, the brain releases hormones and neurotransmitters (ex. glucocorticoids and catecholamines) which affect memory encoding processes in the hippocampus. Behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces adrenal hormones which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats. An experimental study by German cognitive psychologists L. Schwabe and O. Wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans. In this study, 48 healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group. Those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water (the reputable SECPT or \u2018Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test\u2019) for up to three minutes, while being monitored and videotaped. Both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memorize. Twenty-four hours later, both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember (free recall) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words (recognition performance). The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group, who recalled 30% fewer words than the control group. The researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process."},{"qas":[{"question":"Does sleep hurt a persons memory?","id":"571a782d10f8ca1400305067","answers":[{"text":"There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory,","answer_start":268}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does SWS stand for?","id":"571a782d10f8ca1400305068","answers":[{"text":"slow-wave sleep","answer_start":451}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What take place during SWS?","id":"571a782d10f8ca1400305069","answers":[{"text":"System consolidation","answer_start":411}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the role of the neocortex whe it relates to memory?","id":"571a782d10f8ca140030506a","answers":[{"text":"reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory","answer_start":828}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In studies what is a relationship between sleeping and learning?","id":"571a782d10f8ca140030506b","answers":[{"text":"activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day","answer_start":1693}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake","answer_start":0}],"question":"Why does sleep affect recall?","id":"5a8ced20fd22b3001a8d9030","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"During sleep","answer_start":130}],"question":"When are the neural connections in the brain weakened?","id":"5a8ced20fd22b3001a8d9031","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"slow-wave sleep","answer_start":451}],"question":"What does WSW stand for?","id":"5a8ced20fd22b3001a8d9032","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"System consolidation","answer_start":411}],"question":"What take place during WSW?","id":"5a8ced20fd22b3001a8d9033","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory","answer_start":828}],"question":"What is the role of the neocortex whe it relates to muscles?","id":"5a8ced20fd22b3001a8d9034","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake. Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain\u2019s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn\u2019t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning. Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory. Therefore, it is important to get the proper amount of sleep so that memory can function at the highest level. One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test. Additionally, data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day, suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is a term to describe memory loss?","id":"571a7a2810f8ca140030508d","answers":[{"text":"amnesia.","answer_start":130}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What diseases can have a major imact on memory?","id":"571a7a2810f8ca140030508e","answers":[{"text":"Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease","answer_start":771}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is Korsakoff's syndrome?","id":"571a7a2810f8ca140030508f","answers":[{"text":"an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex.","answer_start":1151}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Is amnesia only seen in one form?","id":"571a7a2810f8ca1400305090","answers":[{"text":"There are many sorts of amnesia,","answer_start":487}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happens to a person whose autobiographic memory is damaged?","id":"571a7a2810f8ca1400305091","answers":[{"text":"that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored","answer_start":983}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"amnesia","answer_start":130}],"question":"What is a term to describe memory gain?","id":"5a8ce73afd22b3001a8d8fec","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease","answer_start":771}],"question":"What diseases does not have a major impact on memory?","id":"5a8ce73afd22b3001a8d8fed","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex","answer_start":1151}],"question":"What is Alzheimer's syndrome?","id":"5a8ce73afd22b3001a8d8fee","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"There are many sorts of amnesia","answer_start":487}],"question":"Why is amnesia only seen in one form?","id":"5a8ce73afd22b3001a8d8fef","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored","answer_start":988}],"question":"What happens to a person whose biographic memory is damaged?","id":"5a8ce73afd22b3001a8d8ff0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying memory disorders, particularly amnesia.

There are many sorts of amnesia, and by studying their different forms, it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain's memory systems, and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain. Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also affect memory and cognition. Hyperthymesia, or hyperthymesic syndrome, is a disorder that affects an individual's autobiographical memory, essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and\/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with hit. There was no broken glass depicted in the film. Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers\u2019 memories of the event. Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event \u2013 those who were asked the question with smashed recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen. The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect."}]},"166":{"title":"Multiracial_American","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Who were not identified by name on the census before the civil war?","id":"571de3ebb64a571400c71dd8","answers":[{"text":"slaves","answer_start":263}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was Thomas Jefferson in a relationship with?","id":"571de3ebb64a571400c71dd9","answers":[{"text":"Sally Hemings","answer_start":516}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Not recognizing white fatherhood for multiracial slave children cause what to be lost?","id":"571de3ebb64a571400c71dda","answers":[{"text":"paternity","answer_start":598}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who will not reveal full ancestral data to mixed race people?","id":"571de3ebb64a571400c71ddb","answers":[{"text":"elder family members","answer_start":89}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"people of mixed African-American and Native American descent","answer_start":10}],"question":"What people report having elder family members who were open with genealogical information?","id":"5ad2b36bd7d075001a429f90","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Tracing the genealogy of African Americans","answer_start":158}],"question":"What is usually a very easy process?","id":"5ad2b36bd7d075001a429f91","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"censuses","answer_start":237}],"question":"What identified slaves by name before the American Civil War?","id":"5ad2b36bd7d075001a429f92","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"white fathers","answer_start":404}],"question":"Who acknowledged their mixed-race slave children in records?","id":"5ad2b36bd7d075001a429f93","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Sally Hemings","answer_start":516}],"question":"Who was John Adams in a relationship with?","id":"5ad2b36bd7d075001a429f94","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Sometimes people of mixed African-American and Native American descent report having had elder family members withholding pertinent genealogical information.

Assuming this reference point the linkage disequilibrium in the Ashkenazi Jewish population was interpreted as \"matches signs of interbreeding or 'admixture' between Middle Eastern and European populations\". On the Bray et al. tree, Ashkenazi Jews were found to be a genetically more divergent population than Russians, Orcadians, French, Basques, Italians, Sardinians and Tuscans. The study also observed that Ashkenazim are more diverse than their Middle Eastern relatives, which was counterintuitive because Ashkenazim are supposed to be a subset, not a superset, of their assumed geographical source population. Bray et al. therefore postulate that these results reflect not the population antiquity but a history of mixing between genetically distinct populations in Europe. However, it's possible that the relaxation of marriage prescription in the ancestors of Ashkenazim that drove their heterozygosity up, while the maintenance of the FBD rule in native Middle Easterners have been keeping their heterozygosity values in check. Ashkenazim distinctiveness as found in the Bray et al. study, therefore, may come from their ethnic endogamy (ethnic inbreeding), which allowed them to \"mine\" their ancestral gene pool in the context of relative reproductive isolation from European neighbors, and not from clan endogamy (clan inbreeding). Consequently, their higher diversity compared to Middle Easterners stems from the latter's marriage practices, not necessarily from the former's admixture with Europeans."},{"qas":[{"question":"For religious Jews, what does Minhagim mean?","id":"571a79a64faf5e1900b8a9ba","answers":[{"text":"customs","answer_start":30}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"For religious Jews, what does Halakha mean?","id":"571a79a64faf5e1900b8a9bb","answers":[{"text":"religious law","answer_start":66}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"For religious Jews, \"Ashkenazic\" refers to what two things?","id":"571a79a64faf5e1900b8a9bc","answers":[{"text":"a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry","answer_start":952}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Reform Judaism originated among what type of Jew?","id":"571a79a64faf5e1900b8a9bd","answers":[{"text":"Ashkenazi Jews","answer_start":1127}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of Jew is required to follow the customs of their ancestors without the option of picking and choosing?","id":"571a79a64faf5e1900b8a9be","answers":[{"text":"Orthodox Jews","answer_start":263}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Religious Jews have Minhagim, customs, in addition to Halakha, or religious law, and different interpretations of law.

For this reason, observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household's religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow. These times include, for example, when two Jews of different ethnic background marry, when a non-Jew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time, or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family's past.

The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins.

The dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious disease that occurred during these years. Vaccine development continued to accelerate, with the most notable achievement of the period being Jonas Salk's 1954 development of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. The vaccine process was never patented, but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic. In 1960 Maurice Hilleman of Merck Sharp & Dohme identified the SV40 virus, which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species.

However, only after rigorous study and testing, which takes 10 to 15 years on average, will governmental authorities grant permission for the company to market and sell the drug. Patent protection enables the owner of the patent to recover the costs of research and development through high profit margins for the branded drug. When the patent protection for the drug expires, a generic drug is usually developed and sold by a competing company. The development and approval of generics is less expensive, allowing them to be sold at a lower price. Often the owner of the branded drug will introduce a generic version before the patent expires in order to get a head start in the generic market. Restructuring has therefore become routine, driven by the patent expiration of products launched during the industry's \"golden era\" in the 1990s and companies' failure to develop sufficient new blockbuster products to replace lost revenues."}]},"169":{"title":"Umayyad_Caliphate","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What form of tax were Christians required to pay?","id":"571a9f6a4faf5e1900b8ab42","answers":[{"text":"jizya","answer_start":570}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was the mother of Yazid?","id":"571a9f6a4faf5e1900b8ab43","answers":[{"text":"Maysum","answer_start":713}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was Maysum's religion?","id":"571a9f6a4faf5e1900b8ab44","answers":[{"text":"Christian","answer_start":748}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Christian and Jewish","answer_start":108}],"question":"What populations did not have autonomy?","id":"5acf6e1877cf76001a684e16","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Umar ibn al Khattab","answer_start":658}],"question":"Who ended the Muslim welfare state?","id":"5acf6e1877cf76001a684e17","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Christians","answer_start":1096}],"question":"What religion never held prominent positions in the Caliphate?","id":"5acf6e1877cf76001a684e18","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"This policy","answer_start":1378}],"question":"What caused Muawiya to become less popular?","id":"5acf6e1877cf76001a684e19","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Syria","answer_start":982}],"question":"What part of the empire remained largely Jewish?","id":"5acf6e1877cf76001a684e1a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"At the time, the Umayyad taxation and administrative practice were perceived as unjust by some Muslims.

Muhammad had stated explicitly during his lifetime that abrahamic religious groups (still a majority in times of the Umayyad Caliphate), should be allowed to practice their own religion, provided that they paid the jizya taxation.

The relations between the Muslims and the Christians in the state were stable in this time. The Umayyads were involved in frequent battles with the Christian Byzantines without being concerned with protecting themselves in Syria, which had remained largely Christian like many other parts of the empire. Prominent positions were held by Christians, some of whom belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious assimilation that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, as in Syria.

Seven months later, in February 658, the two arbitrators met at Adhruh, about 10 miles north west of Maan in Jordon. Amr ibn al-As convinced Abu Musa Ashaari that both Ali and Muawiyah should step down and a new Caliph be elected. Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision which had lowered the Caliph to the status of the rebellious Muawiyah I. Ali was therefore outwitted by Muawiyah and Amr. Ali refused to accept the verdict and found himself technically in breach of his pledge to abide by the arbitration. This put Ali in a weak position even amongst his own supporters. The most vociferous opponents in Ali's camp were the very same people who had forced Ali into the ceasefire.

Brown died 10 days after her accident, and to the consternation of her private secretary, Sir Henry Ponsonby, Victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of Brown. Ponsonby and Randall Davidson, Dean of Windsor, who had both seen early drafts, advised Victoria against publication, on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair. The manuscript was destroyed. In early 1884, Victoria did publish More Leaves from a Journal of a Life in the Highlands, a sequel to her earlier book, which she dedicated to her \"devoted personal attendant and faithful friend John Brown\". On the day after the first anniversary of Brown's death, Victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son, Leopold, had died in Cannes. He was \"the dearest of my dear sons\", she lamented.

The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948.

The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration. Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces.

Relations between Israel and Greece have improved since 1995 due to the decline of Israeli-Turkish relations. The two countries have a defense cooperation agreement and in 2010, the Israeli Air Force hosted Greece\u2019s Hellenic Air Force in a joint exercise at the Uvda base. Israel is the second largest importer of Greek products in the Middle East. The joint Cyprus-Israel oil and gas explorations centered on the Leviathan gas field are an important factor for Greece, given its strong links with Cyprus.

Males, known as cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, and have more exaggerated plumage than females (hens). Chickens are gregarious, omnivorous, ground-dwelling birds that in their natural surroundings search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates, and other small animals. They seldom fly except as a result of perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached. Today's domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is mainly descended from the wild red junglefowl of Asia, with some additional input from grey junglefowl. Domestication is believed to have taken place between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago, and what are thought to be fossilized chicken bones have been found in northeastern China dated to around 5,400 BC. Archaeologists believe domestication was originally for the purpose of cockfighting, the male bird being a doughty fighter. By 4,000 years ago, chickens seem to have reached the Indus Valley and 250 years later, they arrived in Egypt. They were still used for fighting and were regarded as symbols of fertility. The Romans used them in divination, and the Egyptians made a breakthrough when they learned the difficult technique of artificial incubation. Since then, the keeping of chickens has spread around the world for the production of food with the domestic fowl being a valuable source of both eggs and meat."},{"qas":[{"question":"do domestic and wild geese have the same apperearance ?","id":"5726488ddd62a815002e806c","answers":[{"text":"Domestic geese are much larger than their wild counterparts and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What types of geese are used for human consumption?","id":"5726488ddd62a815002e806d","answers":[{"text":"The greylag-derived birds","answer_start":149}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What types of geese are used most efficiently for their egg production?","id":"5726488ddd62a815002e806e","answers":[{"text":"Chinese geese","answer_start":225}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the down feathers of geese most commonly used for ?","id":"5726488ddd62a815002e806f","answers":[{"text":"use in pillows and padded garments","answer_start":335}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Why is the meat of geese considered fatty ?","id":"5726488ddd62a815002e8070","answers":[{"text":"they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids","answer_start":874}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Chinese goose","answer_start":692}],"question":"What goose is unable to make any sound?","id":"5a85e6b9b4e223001a8e72a5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"use in pillows and padded garments","answer_start":335}],"question":"What is the down feathers of geese never used for?","id":"5a85e6b9b4e223001a8e72a6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids","answer_start":874}],"question":"Why is the meat of geese considered lean?","id":"5a85e6b9b4e223001a8e72a7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"greylag-derived birds","answer_start":153}],"question":"What is the only type of goose not used for human consumption?","id":"5a85e6b9b4e223001a8e72a8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Domestic geese are much larger than their wild counterparts and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends.

They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and can be used as a guard animal to warn of intruders.

For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green. Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to copyright it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark, and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold \"unofficial\" Arsenal merchandise, Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection. Therefore, in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style, which was copyrightable. The cannon once again faces east and the club's name is written in a sans-serif typeface above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue.

Their research suggests the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern Homo sapiens away from the warm climate of Africa, thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago.

During this period, which has become known as baseball's dead-ball era, Cub infielders Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, and Frank Chance were made famous as a double-play combination by Franklin P. Adams' poem Baseball's Sad Lexicon. The poem first appeared in the July 18, 1910 edition of the New York Evening Mail. Mordecai \"Three-Finger\" Brown, Jack Taylor, Ed Reulbach, Jack Pfiester, and Orval Overall were several key pitchers for the Cubs during this time period. With Chance acting as player-manager from 1905 to 1912, the Cubs won four pennants and two World Series titles over a five-year span. Although they fell to the \"Hitless Wonders\" White Sox in the 1906 World Series, the Cubs recorded a record 116 victories and the best winning percentage (.763) in Major League history. With mostly the same roster, Chicago won back-to-back World Series championships in 1907 and 1908, becoming the first Major League club to play three times in the Fall Classic and the first to win it twice.

After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings. Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1\u20442 game in front.

In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back.

After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the National League MVP Award. After a down-to-the-wire Wild Card chase with the San Francisco Giants, Chicago and San Francisco ended the regular season tied, and thus squared off in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field in which third baseman Gary Gaetti hit the eventual game winning homer. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason once again with a 90\u201373 regular season tally. Unfortunately, the bats went cold in October, as manager Jim Riggleman's club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by Atlanta. On a positive note, the home run chase between Sosa, McGwire and Ken Griffey, Jr. helped professional baseball to bring in a new crop of fans as well as bringing back some fans who had been disillusioned by the 1994 strike. The Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in '98, and after a fast start in 1999, they collapsed again (starting with being swept at the hands of the cross-town White Sox in mid-June) and finished in the bottom of the division for the next two seasons."},{"qas":[{"question":"When did the Ricketts family acquire a majority interest in the Cubs?","id":"57267806708984140094c72b","answers":[{"text":"2009","answer_start":64}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who did Chicago engage in a see-saw battle for first place into August 2009?","id":"57267806708984140094c72c","answers":[{"text":"St. Louis","answer_start":344}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What plagued the Cubs in 2009?","id":"57267806708984140094c72d","answers":[{"text":"injuries","answer_start":610}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"The Ricketts family acquired a majority interest in the Cubs in 2009, ending the Tribune years.

PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war. In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy, Hong Xuezhi, to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing. What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but that they had nothing to eat, no bullets to shoot, and no trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded. Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving methods of supply, but these efforts were never completely sufficient.

He believed that whether or not to use nuclear weapons should be his own decision, not the President's. MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered. While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia, and felt a truce and orderly withdrawal from Korea could be a valid solution. MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined that he had defied the orders of the President and thus had violated the U.S. Constitution.

Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. Although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. The genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. Quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation. However, although the genetic sites are known, there is still much to learn about how these genes are expressed."},{"qas":[{"question":"To be able to maintain a constant body temperature, what do mammals need to maintain?","id":"5726420638643c19005ad39f","answers":[{"text":"nutritious and plentiful diet","answer_start":92}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does a omnivore imply?","id":"5726420638643c19005ad3a0","answers":[{"text":"eats both prey and plants","answer_start":491}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What do the majority of mammals under 18 oz eat?","id":"5726420638643c19005ad3a1","answers":[{"text":"insects","answer_start":1674}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What determines a mammals diet type?","id":"5726420638643c19005ad3a2","answers":[{"text":"The size","answer_start":973}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a nutritious and plentiful diet","answer_start":90}],"question":"What do herbivores use to maintain a high level of bacteria for digestion?","id":"5a3a13d62f14dd001ac726e3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a simple digestive tract","answer_start":543}],"question":"What do herbivores have because they don't need specialized digestion?","id":"5a3a13d62f14dd001ac726e4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The size of an animal","answer_start":973}],"question":"What is a factor that determines body temperature?","id":"5a3a13d62f14dd001ac726e5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"bacteria","answer_start":812}],"question":"What lives in an omnivores digestive tract?","id":"5a3a13d62f14dd001ac726e6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum","answer_start":922}],"question":"Where are bacteria for digestion housed in an omnivore?","id":"5a3a13d62f14dd001ac726e7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive \u2013 mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals \u2013 this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type. Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that weigh less than about 18 oz (500 g) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of a herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (those that prey on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than 18 oz (500 g) usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves. The only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects (ants or termites)."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the name given when zones of gradation exits?","id":"572643c7994a9e14006f0189","answers":[{"text":"clines","answer_start":525}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the given name of a lion and tiger hybrid?","id":"572643c7994a9e14006f018a","answers":[{"text":"liger","answer_start":1019}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the marketed name given in the meat industry when you involve a european or indian domestic cattle mixed with an American bison?","id":"572643c7994a9e14006f018b","answers":[{"text":"Beefalo","answer_start":1264}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the given name of a offspring from two different animals?","id":"572643c7994a9e14006f018c","answers":[{"text":"hybrid","answer_start":2523}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"clines","answer_start":525}],"question":"What is a zone of resilience referred to as?","id":"5a3a17452f14dd001ac726ed","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"hybrid vigor","answer_start":793}],"question":"What does it mean when closely related species exhibit greater strength and resilience than their parents?","id":"5a3a17452f14dd001ac726ee","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"behavior traits, natural hostility, natural ranges and breeding cycle differences","answer_start":1853}],"question":"What are some examples that show how strength and resilience is maintained in related species?","id":"5a3a17452f14dd001ac726ef","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"because their parents usually have slightly different numbers of chromosomes","answer_start":1458}],"question":"Why are ligers more fertile than donkeys?","id":"5a3a17452f14dd001ac726f0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"in circuses","answer_start":1081}],"question":"Where is an American bison sometimes used to entertain people?","id":"5a3a17452f14dd001ac726f1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown in recent times for economic purposes. The number of successful interspecific mammalian hybrids is relatively small, although it has come to be known that there is a significant number of naturally occurring hybrids between forms or regional varieties of a single species.[citation needed] These may form zones of gradation known as clines. Indeed, the distinction between some hitherto distinct species can become clouded once it can be shown that they may not only breed but produce fertile offspring. Some hybrid animals exhibit greater strength and resilience than either parent. This is known as hybrid vigor. The existence of the mule (donkey sire; horse dam) being used widely as a hardy draught animal throughout ancient and modern history is testament to this. Other well known examples are the lion\/tiger hybrid, the liger, which is by far the largest big cat and sometimes used in circuses; and cattle hybrids such as between European and Indian domestic cattle or between domestic cattle and American bison, which are used in the meat industry and marketed as Beefalo. There is some speculation that the donkey itself may be the result of an ancient hybridisation between two wild ass species or sub-species. Hybrid animals are normally infertile partly because their parents usually have slightly different numbers of chromosomes, resulting in unpaired chromosomes in their cells, which prevents division of sex cells and the gonads from operating correctly, particularly in males. There are exceptions to this rule, especially if the speciation process was relatively recent or incomplete as is the case with many cattle and dog species. Normally behavior traits, natural hostility, natural ranges and breeding cycle differences maintain the separateness of closely related species and prevent natural hybridisation. However, the widespread disturbances to natural animal behaviours and range caused by human activity, cities, dumping grounds with food, agriculture, fencing, roads and so on do force animals together which would not normally breed. Clear examples exist between the various sub-species of grey wolf, coyote and domestic dog in North America. As many birds and mammals imprint on their mother and immediate family from infancy, a practice used by animal hybridizers is to foster a planned parent in a hybridization program with the same species as the one with which they are planned to mate."}]},"189":{"title":"East_India_Company","paragraphs":[]},"190":{"title":"Hokkien","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Most Hokkein morphemes have what type of characters?","id":"5726c95cf1498d1400e8eb30","answers":[{"text":"standard designated","answer_start":34}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In some cases, charcters are invented to represent what?","id":"5726c95cf1498d1400e8eb31","answers":[{"text":"a particular morpheme","answer_start":730}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Hokkien morphemes are not always what?","id":"5726c95cf1498d1400e8eb32","answers":[{"text":"etymological or phono-semantic","answer_start":86}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are often borrowed to represent a particular morpheme?","id":"5726c95cf1498d1400e8eb33","answers":[{"text":"Similar-sounding, similar-meaning or rare characters","answer_start":118}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Similar-sounding, similar-meaning or rare characters","answer_start":118}],"question":"What are borrowed in Taiwanese to represent a certain morpheme?","id":"5a1e20f93de3f40018b264dc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"multiple and unrelated pronunciations","answer_start":874}],"question":"What do some literary readings have to represent Hokkien words?","id":"5a1e20f93de3f40018b264dd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"standard designated","answer_start":34}],"question":"What type of characters do most colloquial mophemes have?","id":"5a1e20f93de3f40018b264de","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"they are not always etymological or phono-semantic.","answer_start":66}],"question":"What characteristic do personal pronouns not always have?","id":"5a1e20f93de3f40018b264df","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"characters","answer_start":693}],"question":"What are invented to represent a multiple and unrelated pronunciation?","id":"5a1e20f93de3f40018b264e0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"While most Hokkien morphemes have standard designated characters, they are not always etymological or phono-semantic.

In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term \"ref bump\". While the referee remains \"unconscious\", wrestlers are free to violate rules until the referee is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked them out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into a referee at a slower speed, knocking the ref down for short amount of time; during that interim period, one wrestler may pin their opponent for a three-count and would have won the match but for the referee being down (sometimes, another referee will sprint to the ring from backstage to attempt to make the count, but by then, the other wrestler has had enough time to kick-out on their own accord)."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is one way a match can end?","id":"572665d8708984140094c4bb","answers":[{"text":"in a draw","answer_start":39}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is one reason a draw can result?","id":"572665d8708984140094c4bc","answers":[{"text":"if both opponents are simultaneously disqualified","answer_start":64}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What usually happens regarding a championship during a draw?","id":"572665d8708984140094c4bd","answers":[{"text":"may not change hands in the event of a draw","answer_start":787}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is another name for a one hour draw?","id":"572665d8708984140094c4be","answers":[{"text":"\"Broadway\"","answer_start":1162}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"A professional wrestling match can end in a draw.

Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, he decided to strike first and turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the Rhine. His basic objective was to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could arrive. On 25 September, after great secrecy and feverish marching, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 260 km (160 mi). Austrian commander Karl Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Swabia. Napoleon swung his forces to the southeast and the Grande Arm\u00e9e performed an elaborate wheeling movement that outflanked the Austrian positions. The Ulm Maneuver completely surprised General Mack, who belatedly understood that his army had been cut off. After some minor engagements that culminated in the Battle of Ulm, Mack finally surrendered after realizing that there was no way to break out of the French encirclement. For just 2000 French casualties, Napoleon had managed to capture a total of 60,000 Austrian soldiers through his army's rapid marching. The Ulm Campaign is generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece and was influential in the development of the Schlieffen Plan in the late 19th century. For the French, this spectacular victory on land was soured by the decisive victory that the Royal Navy attained at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October.

You have become Europe's indispensable nation.\" According to Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at The National Interest, such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany's history. \"This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II.

The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its Nazi past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed\u2014and not represented\u2014by Nazism. The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy.

In addition, there are also older tribal religious practices in remote areas of Sarawak in East Malaysia,Highland Philippines and Papua in eastern Indonesia.

Harris made several important changes to the school, reorganizing it into a true university, whereas before, its organization had remnants of the Academy days. At the beginning of his tenure, the school was not officially recognized as a university by any accreditation organization. By the end of his term, the school was accredited under all major accrediting organizations at the time. He was eventually replaced by Howard S. McDonald, who received his doctorate from the University of California. When he first received the position, the Second World War had just ended, and thousands of students were flooding into BYU. By the end of his stay, the school had grown nearly five times to an enrollment of 5,440 students. The university did not have the facilities to handle such a large influx, so he bought part of an Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah and rebuilt it to house some of the students. The next president, Ernest L. Wilkinson, also oversaw a period of intense growth, as the school adopted an accelerated building program. Wilkinson was responsible for the building of over eighty structures on the campus, many of which still stand. During his tenure, the student body increased six times, making BYU the largest private school at the time. The quality of the students also increased, leading to higher educational standards at the school. Finally, Wilkinson reorganized the LDS Church units on campus, with ten stakes and over 100 wards being added during his administration."},{"qas":[{"question":"Who ranked BYU as the best college in Utah?","id":"572889ae3acd2414000dfab3","answers":[{"text":"Forbes Magazine","answer_start":1064}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who designated BYU as having high research activity?","id":"572889ae3acd2414000dfab4","answers":[{"text":"Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching","answer_start":1009}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who ranked BYU the vest value for college in 2007?","id":"572889ae3acd2414000dfab5","answers":[{"text":"The Princeton Review","answer_start":265}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where was BYU  ranked No. 12 in schools with the lowest student-incurred debt?","id":"572889ae3acd2414000dfab6","answers":[{"text":"U.S. News and World Report's \"Great Schools, Great Prices\" lineup","answer_start":468}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In 2008-2009, how was BYU ranked nationally for the number of students who go on to earn PhDs?","id":"572889ae3acd2414000dfab7","answers":[{"text":"No. 10","answer_start":685}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"66th","answer_start":58}],"question":"Where did BYU rank in 2013 in the U.S. News & World Report rankings?","id":"5ace9fdd32bba1001ae4ada3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"No. 21","answer_start":230}],"question":"Where did BYU rank in 2016 in the Quarterly Journal of Economics study?","id":"5ace9fdd32bba1001ae4ada4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the best","answer_start":301}],"question":"Where did Princeton Review rank BYU in 2004 for best value for college?","id":"5ace9fdd32bba1001ae4ada5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"No. 10","answer_start":685}],"question":"Where was BYU ranked in 2014 for number of students who go on to earn PhDs?","id":"5ace9fdd32bba1001ae4ada6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"No. 1 nationally","answer_start":754}],"question":"Where was BYU ranked in 2014 for students who go on to dental school?","id":"5ace9fdd32bba1001ae4ada7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"For 2016, U.S. News & World Report ranked BYU as tied for 66th for national universities in the United States.

The American Association of University Professors has claimed that \"infringements on academic freedom are distressingly common and that the climate for academic freedom is distressingly poor.\" The new rules have not affected BYU's accreditation, as the university's chosen accrediting body allows \"religious colleges and universities to place limitations on academic freedom so long as they publish those limitations candidly\", according to associate academic vice president Jim Gordon.

Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \"Cougars\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code violations. Beginning in the 2011 season, BYU football competes in college football as an independent. In addition, most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference. Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.

Some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be \"absolute protection\". \"If some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation, they reason, more is better. The thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions\". This absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of \"real\" property, typically adopting its law and rhetoric. Other recent developments in intellectual property law, such as the America Invents Act, stress international harmonization. Recently there has also been much debate over the desirability of using intellectual property rights to protect cultural heritage, including intangible ones, as well as over risks of commodification derived from this possibility.

The second, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.)

The Recording Industry Association of America, in particular, has been on the front lines of the fight against copyright infringement, which the industry calls \"piracy\". The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company Napster, and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based digital rights management tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act have been enacted, that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the Copyright Directive. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91\/250\/EEC), and the Conditional Access Directive of 1998 (98\/84\/EEC).

In \"The Prophet's Song\", an eight-minute epic, the middle section is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. The Mercury penned ballad, \"Love of My Life\", featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies. The album was very successful in Britain, and went triple platinum in the United States. The British public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. It has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th greatest of all time, while an ABC poll saw the Australian public vote it the 28th greatest of all time. A Night at the Opera has frequently appeared in \"greatest albums\" lists reflecting the opinions of critics. Among other accolades, it was ranked number 16 in Q Magazine's \"The 50 Best British Albums Ever\" in 2004, and number 11 in Rolling Stone's \"The 100 Greatest Albums of All Time\" as featured in their Mexican edition in 2004.

It also reached number nine in the United States (a 1992 re-release reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks). It is the only single ever to sell a million copies on two separate occasions, and became the Christmas number one twice in the UK, the only single ever to do so. \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" has been voted numerous times the greatest song of all time. The band decided to make a video to help go with the single and hired Trilion, a subsidiary of the former management company Trident Studios, using new technology to create the video; the result is generally considered to have been the first \"true\" music video ever produced, and popularised the medium. The album's first track \"Death on Two Legs\" is said to be written by Mercury about Norman Sheffield and the former management at Trident who helped make the video so popular. Although other bands, including the Beatles, had made short promotional films or videos of songs prior to this, generally, those were specifically made to be aired on specific television shows. On the impact of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Rolling Stone states: \"Its influence cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air.\" The second single from the album, \"You're My Best Friend\", the second song composed by John Deacon, and his first single, peaked at number sixteen in the United States and went on to become a worldwide Top Ten hit.

The altar is called the communion table and the altar area is called the Chancel by Presbyterians. In a Presbyterian (Reformed Church) there may be an altar cross, either on the communion table or on a table in the chancel. By using the \"empty\" cross, or cross of the resurrection, Presbyterians emphasize the resurrection and that Christ is not continually dying, but died once and is alive for all eternity. Some Presbyterian church buildings are often decorated with a cross that has a circle around the center, or Celtic cross. This not only emphasized the resurrection, but also acknowledges historical aspects of Presbyterianism. A baptismal font will be located either at the entrance or near the chancel area. Presbyterian architecture generally makes significant use of symbolism. You may also find decorative and ornate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the bible. Some Presbyterian churches will also have ornate statues of Christ or Graven Scenes from the Last Supper located behind the Chancel.

Furthermore, there are some Orthodox communities of Eastern European migrants and some traditional Protestant Free churches in Thuringia without any societal influence."},{"qas":[{"question":"How many non-Germans lived in Thuringia in 2013?","id":"572664f8f1498d1400e8de26","answers":[{"text":"41,000","answer_start":25}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the increase in non-German population between 2011 and 2013?","id":"572664f8f1498d1400e8de27","answers":[{"text":"24%","answer_start":233}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much of the Thuringian population are migrants?","id":"572664f8f1498d1400e8de28","answers":[{"text":"4%","answer_start":262}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the largest group of foreigners?","id":"572664f8f1498d1400e8de29","answers":[{"text":"Russians","answer_start":428}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which towns have the highest immigrant population?","id":"572664f8f1498d1400e8de2a","answers":[{"text":"Erfurt, Jena, Weimar and Ilmenau","answer_start":586}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"41,000","answer_start":25}],"question":"How many non-Americans lived in Thuringia in 2013?","id":"5a7cc670e8bc7e001a9e1feb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"24%","answer_start":233}],"question":"What was the decrease in non-German population between 2011 and 2013?","id":"5a7cc670e8bc7e001a9e1fec","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"4%","answer_start":262}],"question":"How much of the Thuringian population are against migrants?","id":"5a7cc670e8bc7e001a9e1fed","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Russians","answer_start":428}],"question":"What is the smallest group of foreigners?","id":"5a7cc670e8bc7e001a9e1fee","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Erfurt, Jena, Weimar and Ilmenau","answer_start":586}],"question":"Which towns have the smallest immigrant population?","id":"5a7cc670e8bc7e001a9e1fef","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In July 2013, there were 41,000 non-Germans by citizenship living in Thuringia (1.9% of the population \u2212 among the smallest proportions of any state in Germany).

The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hesse via Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting Thuringia's most important cities. At Hermsdorf junction it is connected with the A9. Both highways were widened from four to six lanes (three each way) after 1990, including some extensive re-routing in the Eisenach and Jena areas. Furthermore, three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s. The A71 crosses the Land in southwest-northeast direction, connecting W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria via Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt and S\u00f6mmerda with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. The crossing of the Thuringian Forest by the A71 has been one of Germany's most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels (including Germany's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel) and large bridges. The A73 starts at the A71 south of Erfurt in Suhl and runs south towards Nuremberg in Bavaria. The A38 is another west-east connection in the north of Thuringia running from G\u00f6ttingen in Lower Saxony via Heiligenstadt and Nordhausen to Leipzig in Saxony. Furthermore, there is a dense network of federal highways complementing the motorway network. The upgrading of federal highways is prioritised in the federal trunk road programme 2015 (Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2015).

By 1920, many branch lines had been built, giving Thuringia one of the densest rail networks in the world before World War II with about 2,500 km of track. Between 1950 and 2000 most of the branch lines were abandoned, reducing Thuringia's network by half compared to 1940. On the other hand, most of the main lines were refurbished after 1990, resulting in improved speed of travel. The most important railway lines at present are the Thuringian Railway, connecting Halle and Leipzig via Weimar, Erfurt, Gotha and Eisenach with Frankfurt and Kassel and the Saal Railway from Halle\/Leipzig via Jena and Saalfeld to Nuremberg. The former has an hourly ICE\/IC service from Dresden to Frankfurt while the latter is served hourly by ICE trains from Berlin to Munich. In 2017, a new high speed line will be opened, diverting long-distance services from these mid-19th century lines. Both ICE routes will then use the Erfurt\u2013Leipzig\/Halle high-speed railway, and the Berlin-Munich route will continue via the Nuremberg\u2013Erfurt high-speed railway. Only the segment west of Erfurt of the Frankfurt-Dresden line will continue to be used by ICE trains after 2017, with an increased line speed of 200 km\/h (currently 160 km\/h). Erfurt's central station, which was completely rebuilt for this purpose in the 2000s (decade), will be the new connection between both ICE lines. The most important regional railway lines in Thuringia are the Neudietendorf\u2013Ritschenhausen railway from Erfurt to W\u00fcrzburg and Meiningen, the Weimar\u2013Gera railway from Erfurt to Chemnitz, the Sangerhausen\u2013Erfurt railway from Erfurt to Magdeburg, the Gotha\u2013Leinefelde railway from Erfurt to G\u00f6ttingen, the Halle\u2013Kassel railway from Halle via Nordhausen to Kassel and the Leipzig\u2013Hof railway from Leipzig via Altenburg to Zwickau and Hof.

Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \"donor\" organism(s)."},{"qas":[{"question":"What do household animals prey upon?

Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale. Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely. For example, some predators cannot digest bones, while others can. Some may eat only part of an organism, as in grazing (see below), but still consistently cause its direct death."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the the strata of predator prey interaction called?","id":"57266c0d5951b619008f7241","answers":[{"text":"trophic level","answer_start":240}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the top predator in an environment called?

Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses). A predator at the top of any food chain (that is, one that is preyed upon by no organism) is called an apex predator; examples include the orca, sperm whale, anaconda, Komodo dragon, tiger, lion, tiger shark, Nile crocodile, and most eagles and owls\u2014and even omnivorous humans and grizzly bears. An apex predator in one environment may not retain this position as a top predator if introduced to another habitat, such as a dog among alligators, a skunk in the presence of the great horned owl immune to skunk spray, or a snapping turtle among jaguars; a predatory species introduced into an area where it faces no predators, such as a domestic cat or a dog in some insular environments, can become an apex predator by default."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the phenomenon where an organism looks like another species called?","id":"5726e0c55951b619008f8123","answers":[{"text":"Mimicry","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which organism looks like a bee but cannot sting?","id":"5726e0c55951b619008f8124","answers":[{"text":"drone fly","answer_start":119}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"A moth that has markings resembling an owl's eyes is an example of what phenomenon?","id":"5726e0c55951b619008f8125","answers":[{"text":"Mimicry","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is a defensive way that mimicry can be used?","id":"5726e0c55951b619008f8126","answers":[{"text":"startling the predator and giving it time to escape","answer_start":432}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How can predators use mimicry?","id":"5726e0c55951b619008f8127","answers":[{"text":"to lure their prey","answer_start":516}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a bee","answer_start":153}],"question":"What does a female firefly look like, but isn't able to sting?","id":"5a6bcae74eec6b001a80a5ac","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"light signals of other species","answer_start":607}],"question":"What do drone flies copy to attract male fireflies?","id":"5a6bcae74eec6b001a80a5ad","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"are then captured and eaten","answer_start":680}],"question":"What happens when drone flies attract male fireflies?","id":"5a6bcae74eec6b001a80a5ae","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"an owl's eyes","answer_start":328}],"question":"What do the markings on female fireflies resemble?","id":"5a6bcae74eec6b001a80a5af","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"to escape","answer_start":474}],"question":"Why does a female firefly use the markings on its wings?","id":"5a6bcae74eec6b001a80a5b0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Mimicry is a related phenomenon where an organism has a similar appearance to another species.

When hunger is not an issue, in general most predators will not seek to attack prey since the costs outweigh the benefits. For instance, a large predatory fish like a shark that is well fed in an aquarium will typically ignore the smaller fish swimming around it (while the prey fish take advantage of the fact that the apex predator is apparently uninterested). Surplus killing represents a deviation from this type of behaviour. The treatment of consumption in terms of cost-benefit analysis is known as optimal foraging theory, and has been quite successful in the study of animal behavior. In general, costs and benefits are considered in energy gain per unit time, though other factors are also important, such as essential nutrients that have no caloric value but are necessary for survival and health."},{"qas":[{"question":"When a predator hunts too much of its prey, causing both populations to dissappear, the phenomenon is called what?","id":"5726f429dd62a815002e9622","answers":[{"text":"coextinction","answer_start":1017}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Are predator's effects on prey easiest to see in the short-term or long-term?","id":"5726f429dd62a815002e9623","answers":[{"text":"longer period of time","answer_start":102}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The rise and fall of predator and prey populations are similar to what, in the US economy?","id":"5726f429dd62a815002e9624","answers":[{"text":"boom and bust cycle of economics","answer_start":263}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"in the short-term","answer_start":55}],"question":"When are the effects of economics hard to see?","id":"5a6bf3af4eec6b001a80a610","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the boom and bust cycle of economics","answer_start":259}],"question":"What is the cycle of complete extinction similar to?","id":"5a6bf3af4eec6b001a80a611","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"coextinction","answer_start":1017}],"question":"What risk to conservationists encounter when they cause the predator population to dip?","id":"5a6bf3af4eec6b001a80a612","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find","answer_start":331}],"question":"What happens if wildlife conservationists limit prey populations?","id":"5a6bf3af4eec6b001a80a613","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"will be able to recover","answer_start":1735}],"question":"What does introducing a new prey species guarantee for the weaker predators?","id":"5a6bf3af4eec6b001a80a614","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"A predator's effect on its prey species is hard to see in the short-term. However, if observed over a longer period of time, it is seen that the population of a predator will correlationally rise and fall with the population of its prey in a cycle similar to the boom and bust cycle of economics. If a predator overhunts its prey, the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find. This will cause the predator population to dip, decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population. The decrease in predators will allow the small number of prey left to slowly increase their population to somewhere around their previous abundance, which will allow the predator population to increase in response to the greater availability of resources. If a predator hunts its prey species to numbers too low to sustain the population in the short term, they can cause not only the extinction or extirpation of the prey but also the extinction of their own species, a phenomenon known as coextinction. This is a risk that wildlife conservationists encounter when introducing predators to prey that have not coevolved with the same or similar predators. This possibility depends largely on how well and how fast the prey species is able to adapt to the introduced predator. One way that this risk can be avoided is if the predator finds an alternative prey species or if an alternative prey species is introduced (something that ecologists and environmentalists try to avoid whenever possible). An alternative prey species would help to lift some of the predation pressure from the initial prey species, giving the population a chance to recover, however it does not guarantee that the initial prey species will be able to recover as the initial prey population may have been hunted to below sustainable numbers or to complete extinction."}]},"205":{"title":"Marvel_Comics","paragraphs":[]},"206":{"title":"British_Empire","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What had turned England and Catholic Spain into implacable enemies?","id":"57266351708984140094c47d","answers":[{"text":"the Protestant Reformation","answer_start":185}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did John Hawkins and Francis Drake attack Spanish and Portuguese slave ships?","id":"57266351708984140094c47e","answers":[{"text":"1562","answer_start":279}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where did John Hawkins and Francis Drake attack Spanish and Portuguese slave ships?","id":"57266351708984140094c47f","answers":[{"text":"off the coast of West Africa","answer_start":432}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who gave their blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports?","id":"57266351708984140094c480","answers":[{"text":"Elizabeth I","answer_start":593}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which author was the first to use the term \"British Empire\"?","id":"57266351708984140094c481","answers":[{"text":"John Dee","answer_start":850}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"No further attempts to establish English colonies in the Americas were made until well into the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, during the last decades of the 16th century.

Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $US 4.33 billion loan (US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006.

The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check. The \"wind of change\" ultimately meant that the British Empire's days were numbered, and on the whole, Britain adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies once stable, non-Communist governments were available to transfer power to. This was in contrast to other European powers such as France and Portugal, which waged costly and ultimately unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact.

An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but may be unable to cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers.

The natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in corn, Zea mays, and is a derivative of the purine adenine. Zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts. The gibberelins, such as Gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl CoA via the mevalonate pathway. They are involved in the promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering. Abscisic acid (ABA) occurs in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes seed maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure. It was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission. Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine. It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission, and it, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton, pineapples and other climacteric crops."},{"qas":[{"question":"Do the roots and shoots need each other?","id":"5727881cdd62a815002e9fa0","answers":[{"text":"interdependent","answer_start":41}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What do the roots get from the shoots?","id":"5727881cdd62a815002e9fa1","answers":[{"text":"food","answer_start":132}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What do the shoots get from the roots?","id":"5727881cdd62a815002e9fa2","answers":[{"text":"water and minerals","answer_start":193}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are roots used for in beets and carrots?","id":"5727881cdd62a815002e9fa3","answers":[{"text":"to store food","answer_start":969}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happens if a plant looses roots or its shoots?","id":"5727881cdd62a815002e9fa4","answers":[{"text":"can often regrow it","answer_start":577}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"The root system and the shoot system are interdependent \u2013 the usually nonphotosynthetic root system depends on the shoot system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system.

Roots that spread out close to the surface, such as those of willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants. In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, as is the case with Saintpaulia, or even a single cell \u2013 which can dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant.

Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent \u2013 grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so.

She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, in preparation for the film Who's That Girl.

In areas like antitrust, trademark, and employment law, there are powerful laws at both the federal and state levels that coexist with each other.

Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for many Jewish communities in a number of Post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Although communities in North Africa today are small and dwindling, Jews there had shifted from a multilingual group to a monolingual one (or nearly so), speaking French in Algeria, Morocco, and the city of Tunis, while most North Africans continue to use Arabic as their mother tongue.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"How many Jews were slaughtered in the Holocaust?","id":"5727a4b74b864d190016392e","answers":[{"text":"approximately 6 million","answer_start":113}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Worldwide, how many Jews were there in 1939?","id":"5727a4b74b864d190016392f","answers":[{"text":"15 million","answer_start":158}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the state-led systematic persecution and genocide of European Jews and other minority groups?","id":"5727a4b74b864d1900163930","answers":[{"text":"The Holocaust","answer_start":231}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In 1939, what fraction of Jews were killed in The Holocaust?","id":"5727a4b74b864d1900163931","answers":[{"text":"more than a third","answer_start":183}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Nazi Germany's","answer_start":34}],"question":"Where did the persecution reach its lowest amount?

Concentration camps were established in which inmates were used as slave labour until they died of exhaustion or disease. Where the Third Reich conquered new territory in Eastern Europe, specialized units called Einsatzgruppen murdered Jews and political opponents in mass shootings. Jews and Roma were crammed into ghettos before being transported hundreds of miles by freight train to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, the majority of them were killed in gas chambers.

Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world. While dryland (non-irrigated) cotton is successfully grown in this region, consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on irrigation water drawn from the Ogallala Aquifer. Since cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant, this makes it an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions. As water resources get tighter around the world, economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict, as well as potential environmental problems. For example, improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of Uzbekistan, where cotton is a major export. In the days of the Soviet Union, the Aral Sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation, largely of cotton, and now salination is widespread."},{"qas":[{"question":"What was the first manufactured fiber?","id":"572759cb5951b619008f888d","answers":[{"text":"rayon","answer_start":61}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was rayon first made in France?","id":"572759cb5951b619008f888e","answers":[{"text":"1890s","answer_start":84}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of industry produced a growing chain of synthetic fibers?","id":"572759cb5951b619008f888f","answers":[{"text":"chemicals industry","answer_start":367}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was manufactured completely from petrochemicals?","id":"572759cb5951b619008f8890","answers":[{"text":"Nylon","answer_start":457}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What company produced nylon and acrylic in the 1930s and 1940s?","id":"572759cb5951b619008f8891","answers":[{"text":"DuPont","answer_start":559}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Rayon","answer_start":91}],"question":"What was the first polyester fiber?","id":"5a8192e331013a001a334ccd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1890s","answer_start":84}],"question":"When was polyester first made in France?","id":"5a8192e331013a001a334cce","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"chemicals industry","answer_start":367}],"question":"What type of industry produced a growing chain of DuPont?","id":"5a8192e331013a001a334ccf","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Nylon","answer_start":457}],"question":"What was manufactured completely from DuPont?","id":"5a8192e331013a001a334cd0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"DuPont","answer_start":559}],"question":"What company produced polyester and nylon in the 1930s and 1940s?","id":"5a8192e331013a001a334cd1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The era of manufactured fibers began with the development of rayon in France in the 1890s.

A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades. Acetate in fiber form was developed in 1924. Nylon, the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont's acrylic in 1944. Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's hosiery from nylon, but it was not until the introduction of polyester into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat. The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies, especially in Central American countries, such as Nicaragua, where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides.

Arithmetic coding is a more modern coding technique that uses the mathematical calculations of a finite-state machine to produce a string of encoded bits from a series of input data symbols. It can achieve superior compression to other techniques such as the better-known Huffman algorithm. It uses an internal memory state to avoid the need to perform a one-to-one mapping of individual input symbols to distinct representations that use an integer number of bits, and it clears out the internal memory only after encoding the entire string of data symbols. Arithmetic coding applies especially well to adaptive data compression tasks where the statistics vary and are context-dependent, as it can be easily coupled with an adaptive model of the probability distribution of the input data. An early example of the use of arithmetic coding was its use as an optional (but not widely used) feature of the JPEG image coding standard. It has since been applied in various other designs including H.264\/MPEG-4 AVC and HEVC for video coding."},{"qas":[{"question":"What still remains much shorter than intraframe compression?","id":"57268a7ddd62a815002e88be","answers":[{"text":"longer command","answer_start":446}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happens when a frame contains areas where nothing has moved?","id":"57268a7ddd62a815002e88bf","answers":[{"text":"the system simply issues a short command","answer_start":149}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is a sequence that can be edited?","id":"57268a7ddd62a815002e88c0","answers":[{"text":"video","answer_start":641}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"longer command","answer_start":446}],"question":"What still remains much shorter than video?","id":"5a66c197f038b7001ab0c0ea","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the system simply issues a short command","answer_start":149}],"question":"What happens when a frame contains areas that can be compared?","id":"5a66c197f038b7001ab0c0eb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"video","answer_start":641}],"question":"What is a sequence that can cause rotate?","id":"5a66c197f038b7001ab0c0ec","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a (slightly longer) command","answer_start":338}],"question":"What tells the decompressor to shift, rotate, or copy?","id":"5a66c197f038b7001ab0c0ed","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the compressor emits a (slightly longer) command","answer_start":317}],"question":"What happens if sections of the frame move in a powerful method?","id":"5a66c197f038b7001ab0c0ee","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The most powerful used method works by comparing each frame in the video with the previous one.

Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by moldy food or diseased produce. Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees and brush. They can also kill invasive weeds that may cause environmental damage. Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant. Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mold can damage structures such as houses. Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain. Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk. Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Canada."}]},"216":{"title":"Somerset","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What area lies in the northeastern part of Somerset levels ","id":"57269335708984140094caa7","answers":[{"text":"the Mendip Hills are moderately high limestone hills","answer_start":42}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What area was Designated to have outstanding beauty ","id":"57269335708984140094caa8","answers":[{"text":"Quantock Hills which was England's first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty designated in 1956","answer_start":361}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of the coal field ","id":"57269335708984140094caa9","answers":[{"text":"The Somerset Coalfield is part of a larger coalfield which stretches into Gloucestershire","answer_start":581}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What area support dairy farming ","id":"57269335708984140094caaa","answers":[{"text":"on the clay substrate, are broad valleys which support dairy farming and drain into the Somerset Levels.","answer_start":742}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"198 km2","answer_start":205}],"question":"How much area does the Somerset Coalfield cover?","id":"5acf603a77cf76001a684cc2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"76 sq mi","answer_start":214}],"question":"How much area does the Chew Valley cover?","id":"5acf603a77cf76001a684cc3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Quantock Hills","answer_start":361}],"question":"What lies to the north-west of the Somerset Levels?","id":"5acf603a77cf76001a684cc4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Chew Valley","answer_start":712}],"question":"What lies to the east of the Mendip Hills?","id":"5acf603a77cf76001a684cc5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"oak","answer_start":487}],"question":"What type of trees are prevalent in the Chew Valley?","id":"5acf603a77cf76001a684cc6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"To the north-east of the Somerset Levels, the Mendip Hills are moderately high limestone hills.

The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately 21 \u00b0C (69.8 \u00b0F). In winter mean minimum temperatures of 1 \u00b0C (33.8 \u00b0F) or 2 \u00b0C (35.6 \u00b0F) are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, but convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around 700 mm (28 in).

The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology. It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity.\" In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith.

In 2004 Howard Dean stated, \"In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation\"."},{"qas":[{"question":"When was Yale's residential college system established?","id":"5726efa6dd62a815002e95bc","answers":[{"text":"1933","answer_start":53}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who established Yale's residential college system?","id":"5726efa6dd62a815002e95bd","answers":[{"text":"Edward S.

Calhoun, a slave-owner and strong slavery supporter in the nineteenth century. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change. They argued in the petition that\u2014while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an \"extraordinary American statesman\"\u2014he was \"one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy\" in the history of the United States. In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed. He described Calhoun as a \"a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina.\" He acknowledged that Calhoun also \"believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.\" Racial tensions increased in the fall of 2015 centering on comments by Nicholas A. Christakis and his wife Erika regarding freedom of speech. In April 2016 Salovey announced that \"despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,\" Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's \"shadow\" so they will be \"better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future.\" He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would \"obscure\" his \"legacy of slavery rather than addressing it.\" \"Yale is part of that history\" and \"We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it.\" One change that will be issued is the title of \u201cmaster\u201d for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to \u201chead of college\u201d due to its connotation of slavery."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the name of the world's oldest humor magazine?","id":"5726f456708984140094d6df","answers":[{"text":"The Yale Record","answer_start":100}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What year was The Yale Record first published?","id":"5726f456708984140094d6e0","answers":[{"text":"1872","answer_start":94}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In what year was the Yale Daily News established?","id":"5726f456708984140094d6e1","answers":[{"text":"1878","answer_start":223}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was the Yale Herald established?","id":"5726f456708984140094d6e2","answers":[{"text":"1986","answer_start":286}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of the campus radio station?","id":"5726f456708984140094d6e3","answers":[{"text":"WYBC Yale Radio","answer_start":864}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Yale Record","answer_start":100}],"question":"What is the name of the world's newest humor magazine?","id":"5ad3ebe9604f3c001a3ff741","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1872","answer_start":94}],"question":"What year was The Yale Record last published?","id":"5ad3ebe9604f3c001a3ff742","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1878","answer_start":223}],"question":"In what year was the Yale Daily News closed?","id":"5ad3ebe9604f3c001a3ff743","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1986","answer_start":286}],"question":"When was the Yale Herald closed?","id":"5ad3ebe9604f3c001a3ff744","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"WYBC Yale Radio","answer_start":864}],"question":"What is the name of the campus tv station?","id":"5ad3ebe9604f3c001a3ff745","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers.

It is not unusual for every part of the building to have been built in a different century and in a different style, with no attempt at creating a stylistic unity. Unlike French cathedrals, English cathedrals sprawl across their sites, with double transepts projecting strongly and Lady Chapels tacked on at a later date, such as at Westminster Abbey. In the west front, the doors are not as significant as in France, the usual congregational entrance being through a side porch. The West window is very large and never a rose, which are reserved for the transept gables. The west front may have two towers like a French Cathedral, or none.

The plan is usually regular and symmetrical, Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced columns. The proportions are generally mathematically equilibrated, based on the square and the concept of \"armon\u00eca\", and except in Venice where they loved flamboyant arches, the arches are almost always equilateral. Colours and moldings define the architectural units rather than blending them. Italian cathedral fa\u00e7ades are often polychrome and may include mosaics in the lunettes over the doors.

Contemporary views of Cubism are complex, formed to some extent in response to the \"Salle 41\" Cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of Picasso and Braque to be considered merely secondary to them. Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore developed. Wider views of Cubism include artists who were later associated with the \"Salle 41\" artists, e.g., Francis Picabia; the brothers Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp, who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the Section d'Or (or the Puteaux Group); the sculptors Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky and Ossip Zadkine as well as Jacques Lipchitz and Henri Laurens; and painters such as Louis Marcoussis, Roger de La Fresnaye, Franti\u0161ek Kupka, Diego Rivera, L\u00e9opold Survage, Auguste Herbin, Andr\u00e9 Lhote, Gino Severini (after 1916), Mar\u00eda Blanchard (after 1916) and Georges Valmier (after 1918).

The term \"government\" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in political science, although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and cultural anthropologists have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of natural order was not introduced, the social sciences could not evolve independently of theistic thinking.

To a liberal, a slave who is not interfered with may be free, yet to a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian Quentin Skinner, jurist Cass Sunstein, and political philosopher Philip Pettit. The capability approach, pioneered by economists Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen and further developed by legal scholar Martha Nussbaum, understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act.

This allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal, diffusing into the iron matrix. When this happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in solution, or mixed with the iron, forming a single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called austenite. If the steel is cooled slowly, the iron will gradually change into its low temperature allotrope. When this happens the carbon atoms will no longer be soluble with the iron, and will be forced to precipitate out of solution, nucleating into the spaces between the crystals. The steel then becomes heterogeneous, being formed of two phases; the carbon (carbide) phase cementite, and ferrite. This type of heat treatment produces steel that is rather soft and bendable. However, if the steel is cooled quickly the carbon atoms will not have time to precipitate. When rapidly cooled, a diffusionless (martensite) transformation occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution. This causes the iron crystals to deform intrinsically when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, making it very hard and brittle."},{"qas":[{"question":"Bronze and brass are examples of what?","id":"5726b169708984140094ce07","answers":[{"text":"substitutional alloys","answer_start":522}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Tin or zinc atoms in place of copper atoms create?","id":"5726b169708984140094ce08","answers":[{"text":"substitutional alloys","answer_start":522}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of one interstitial alloy?","id":"5726b169708984140094ce09","answers":[{"text":"Steel","answer_start":965}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Stainless steel is an example of what two alloys?","id":"5726b169708984140094ce0a","answers":[{"text":"interstitial and substitutional","answer_start":1138}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"an alloy","answer_start":93}],"question":"What is formed when molten metal is separated from other substances?","id":"5a209dd78a6e4f001aa08dd4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"substitutional alloy","answer_start":488}],"question":"What is it called when the atoms of the other constituent are substituted with metallic crystals?","id":"5a209dd78a6e4f001aa08dd5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"bronze and brass","answer_start":552}],"question":"What is formed by substituting tin or zinc atoms with copper?","id":"5a209dd78a6e4f001aa08dd6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"interstitial and substitutional allo","answer_start":1138}],"question":"What two alloys is still a combination of?","id":"5a209dd78a6e4f001aa08dd7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"When a molten metal is mixed with another substance, there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form, called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism. The relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent. This is called a substitutional alloy. Examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass, in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms. With the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other, so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal. The smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix, called the interstices. This is referred to as an interstitial alloy. Steel is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix. Stainless steel is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys, because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices, but some of the iron atoms are replaced with nickel and chromium atoms."}]},"224":{"title":"Norfolk_Island","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What services do Norfolk Island residents believe should be made available from the Norfolk Island's EEZ profit?","id":"5726c566708984140094d103","answers":[{"text":"health and infrastructure","answer_start":388}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is Norfolk Island's only major natural resource?","id":"5726c566708984140094d104","answers":[{"text":"fish","answer_start":622}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of the area residents of Norfolk Island are permitted to fish recreationally?","id":"5726c566708984140094d105","answers":[{"text":"the Box","answer_start":897}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is speculated to be available in Norfolk Island's EEZ zone?","id":"5726c566708984140094d106","answers":[{"text":"oil and gas deposits","answer_start":960}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What percentage of Norfolk Island is a permanent pasture?","id":"5726c566708984140094d107","answers":[{"text":"25","answer_start":1071}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"health and infrastructure","answer_start":388}],"question":"What services do Norfolk Island residents believe should be made unavailable from the Norfolk Island's EEZ profit?","id":"5a81c83931013a001a334ea9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"fish","answer_start":622}],"question":"What is Norfolk Island's only resource?","id":"5a81c83931013a001a334eaa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the Box","answer_start":897}],"question":"What is the name of the area residents of Norfolk Island are permitted to fish illegally?","id":"5a81c83931013a001a334eab","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"oil and gas deposits","answer_start":960}],"question":"What is speculated to be forbidden in Norfolk Island's EEZ zone?","id":"5a81c83931013a001a334eac","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"25","answer_start":1071}],"question":"What percentage of Norfolk Island is no longer a permanent pasture?","id":"5a81c83931013a001a334ead","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The Australian government controls the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and revenue from it extending 200 nautical miles (370 km) around Norfolk Island (roughly 428,000km2) and territorial sea claims to three nautical miles (6 km) from the island.

He laid out his objections in an orderly manner, focusing on one before moving to the next. His first concern was that the use of force would have to be temporary, and that the uprisings and objections to British governance in America would not be. Second, Burke worried about the uncertainty surrounding whether Britain would win a conflict in America. \"An armament\", Burke said, \"is not a victory\". Third, Burke brought up the issue of impairment; it would do the British Government no good to engage in a scorched earth war and have the object they desired (America) become damaged or even useless. The American colonists could always retreat into the mountains, but the land they left behind would most likely be unusable, whether by accident or design. The fourth and final reason to avoid the use of force was experience; the British had never attempted to rein in an unruly colony by force, and they did not know if it could be done, let alone accomplished thousands of miles away from home. Not only were all of these concerns reasonable, but some turned out to be prophetic \u2013 the American colonists did not surrender, even when things looked extremely bleak, and the British were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to win a war fought on American soil."},{"qas":[{"question":"Who did Parisian women want to return to Paris?","id":"5726a993dd62a815002e8c53","answers":[{"text":"King Louis XVI","answer_start":564}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was Burke's son's name?","id":"5726a993dd62a815002e8c54","answers":[{"text":"Richard Burke","answer_start":648}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who requested that Burke support the French Revolution?","id":"5726a993dd62a815002e8c55","answers":[{"text":"Charles-Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Depont","answer_start":1046}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did Burke first publicly condemn the French Revolution?","id":"5726a993dd62a815002e8c56","answers":[{"text":"9 February 1790","answer_start":1497}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the French Revolution","answer_start":33}],"question":"What did Burke condemn in August 1789?","id":"5ad0c8c2645df0001a2d031e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"5\u20136 October 1789","answer_start":483}],"question":"When did Burke march in Versailles?","id":"5ad0c8c2645df0001a2d031f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"10 October","answer_start":669}],"question":"When did Burke write to Laurence?","id":"5ad0c8c2645df0001a2d0320","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Charles-Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Depont","answer_start":1046}],"question":"Who did Burke want to support the revolution?","id":"5ad0c8c2645df0001a2d0321","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"9 February 1790","answer_start":1497}],"question":"When did Pitt and Fox officially denounce the revolution?","id":"5ad0c8c2645df0001a2d0322","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Initially, Burke did not condemn the French Revolution.

The events of 5\u20136 October 1789, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to compel King Louis XVI to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In a letter to his son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: \"This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France\u2014where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it\u2014where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable\". On 4 November Charles-Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken \"as no more than the expression of doubt\" but he added: \"You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom\". In the same month he described France as \"a country undone\".

When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada, Fox praised the revolution and criticised some of Burke's arguments, such as hereditary power. On 6 May 1791, during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill, Burke used the opportunity to answer Fox, and to condemn the new French Constitution and \"the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man\". Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions. Burke was interrupted, and Fox intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech.

A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\". He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: \"Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth\".

Burke's friend Philip Francis wrote that Burke \"was a man who truly & prophetically foresaw all the consequences which would rise from the adoption of the French principles\" but because Burke wrote with so much passion, people were doubtful of his arguments. William Windham spoke from the same bench in the House of Commons as Burke had, when he had separated from Fox, and an observer said Windham spoke \"like the ghost of Burke\" when he made a speech against peace with France in 1801. William Hazlitt, a political opponent of Burke, regarded him as amongst his three favourite writers (the others being Junius and Rousseau), and made it \"a test of the sense and candour of any one belonging to the opposite party, whether he allowed Burke to be a great man\". William Wordsworth was originally a supporter of the French Revolution and attacked Burke in 'A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff' (1793), but by the early nineteenth century he had changed his mind and came to admire Burke. In his Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland Wordsworth called Burke \"the most sagacious Politician of his age\" whose predictions \"time has verified\". He later revised his poem The Prelude to include praise of Burke (\"Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced\/By specious wonders\") and portrayed him as an old oak. Samuel Taylor Coleridge came to have a similar conversion: he had criticised Burke in The Watchman, but in his Friend (1809\u201310) Coleridge defended Burke from charges of inconsistency. Later, in his Biographia Literaria (1817) Coleridge hails Burke as a prophet and praises Burke for referring \"habitually to principles. He was a scientific statesman; and therefore a seer\". Henry Brougham wrote of Burke: \"... all his predictions, save one momentary expression, had been more than fulfilled: anarchy and bloodshed had borne sway in France; conquest and convulsion had desolated Europe...the providence of mortals is not often able to penetrate so far as this into futurity\". George Canning believed that Burke's Reflections \"has been justified by the course of subsequent events; and almost every prophecy has been strictly fulfilled\". In 1823 Canning wrote that he took Burke's \"last works and words [as] the manual of my politics\". The Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli \"was deeply penetrated with the spirit and sentiment of Burke's later writings\"."}]},"226":{"title":"Samoa","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What did Lemi Ponifasio name his dance company?","id":"5726dc07f1498d1400e8ed8a","answers":[{"text":"MAU","answer_start":103}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What genre of music greatly influenced the culture in Samoa?","id":"5726dc07f1498d1400e8ed8b","answers":[{"text":"Hip hop","answer_start":218}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What Samoan choreographer founded Black Grace?","id":"5726dc07f1498d1400e8ed8c","answers":[{"text":"Neil Ieremia","answer_start":108}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What professor at the University in Hawaii at Manoa wrote about the relationships between hip hop, dance, and traditional Samoan culture?","id":"5726dc07f1498d1400e8ed8d","answers":[{"text":"Katerina Martina Teaiwa","answer_start":287}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Among what age group in Samoa is hip hop and dance most popular?","id":"5726dc07f1498d1400e8ed8e","answers":[{"text":"youths","answer_start":830}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"international acclaim","answer_start":161}],"question":"What has Neil Leremia's company MAU recieved when touring in Europe and NY?","id":"5a62963af8d794001af1c120","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"director and choreographer","answer_start":20}],"question":"What is Lemi Ponifasio's position at hs company Black Grace?","id":"5a62963af8d794001af1c121","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Hip hop culture","answer_start":357}],"question":"What is popular among Samoan youth according to Lemi Ponifasio?","id":"5a62963af8d794001af1c122","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"youths","answer_start":830}],"question":"Among what group is the dance company MAU popular?","id":"5a62963af8d794001af1c123","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"hip hop","answer_start":511}],"question":"What dance form is taught at the University of Hawaii?","id":"5a62963af8d794001af1c124","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Lemi Ponifasio is a director and choreographer who is prominent internationally with his dance Company MAU.

In the 1880s, many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors because AC's advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC. The first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla, a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887. In 1888, the Royal Academy of Science of Turin published Ferraris' research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that \"the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor.\" In 1888, Tesla presented his paper A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers to the AIEE that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding. One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. George Westinghouse promptly bought Tesla's patents, employed Tesla to develop them, and assigned C. F. Scott to help Tesla, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889.  The constant speed AC induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride, Colorado in 1891. Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890. This type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications. However, he claimed that Tesla's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work. Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until B. G. Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor. The General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the squirrel-cage rotor. Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100 horsepower (HP) induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 HP motor in 1897."},{"qas":[{"question":"How is RFI generated?","id":"5726ae3cdd62a815002e8cce","answers":[{"text":"sparking","answer_start":946}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What do brushes need to be in contact with?","id":"5726ae3cdd62a815002e8ccf","answers":[{"text":"commutator","answer_start":112}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is created by contact between parts of the motor?","id":"5726ae3cdd62a815002e8cd0","answers":[{"text":"friction","answer_start":137}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does sparking limit?","id":"5726ae3cdd62a815002e8cd1","answers":[{"text":"maximum speed","answer_start":645}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What motor components most need replacement and maintenance?

This creates friction. Sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections \u2013 and hence coil ends \u2013 momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the inductance of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their resistivity, limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates electrical noise; sparking generates RFI. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor."},{"qas":[{"question":"What can a PM motor not be adjusted for?","id":"5726b0355951b619008f7a7f","answers":[{"text":"speed control","answer_start":342}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is another name for PM fields?","id":"5726b0355951b619008f7a80","answers":[{"text":"stators","answer_start":368}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What design feature does a PM motor lack?","id":"5726b0355951b619008f7a81","answers":[{"text":"field winding","answer_start":27}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What do field windings provide?","id":"5726b0355951b619008f7a82","answers":[{"text":"flux","answer_start":694}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"produce torque","answer_start":158}],"question":" What can a PMM motor not be adjusted for?","id":"5ad1620e645df0001a2d193c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"dynamo","answer_start":503}],"question":" What is another name for PMM fields?","id":"5ad1620e645df0001a2d193d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"field winding","answer_start":454}],"question":" What design feature does a PMM motor lack?","id":"5ad1620e645df0001a2d193e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"flux","answer_start":694}],"question":" What don't field windings provide?","id":"5ad1620e645df0001a2d193f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"A PM motor does not have a field winding on the stator frame, instead relying on PMs to provide the magnetic field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque.

Taking advantage of this fact is the coreless or ironless DC motor, a specialized form of a PM DC motor. Optimized for rapid acceleration, these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core.

Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in whole wheat flour, nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis \u2013 the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digesta along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Both of these \"omega\" long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins, which is one reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health.

They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of amino acids, which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are essential (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are non-essential (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential and, therefore, must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is another term that can be used to describe \"potentially damaging\" compounds?","id":"5726e03fdd62a815002e9392","answers":[{"text":"mutation causing","answer_start":86}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are oxidizers?","id":"5726e03fdd62a815002e9393","answers":[{"text":"acceptors of electrons","answer_start":182}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In order for the body to function normally, what must be used to neutralize free radicals?","id":"5726e03fdd62a815002e9394","answers":[{"text":"antioxidant compounds","answer_start":361}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What subgroup of phytochemicals helps make up the majority of the body's antioxidants?","id":"5726e03fdd62a815002e9395","answers":[{"text":"polyphenols","answer_start":898}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which area of the body does vitamin A protect?","id":"5726e03fdd62a815002e9396","answers":[{"text":"fat areas","answer_start":1415}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"As cellular metabolism\/energy production requires oxygen, potentially damaging (e.g., mutation causing) compounds known as free radicals can form. Most of these are oxidizers (i.e., acceptors of electrons) and some react very strongly. For the continued normal cellular maintenance, growth, and division, these free radicals must be sufficiently neutralized by antioxidant compounds. Recently, some researchers suggested an interesting theory of evolution of dietary antioxidants. Some are produced by the human body with adequate precursors (glutathione, Vitamin C), and those the body cannot produce may only be obtained in the diet via direct sources (Vitamin C in humans, Vitamin A, Vitamin K) or produced by the body from other compounds (Beta-carotene converted to Vitamin A by the body, Vitamin D synthesized from cholesterol by sunlight). Phytochemicals (Section Below) and their subgroup, polyphenols, make up the majority of antioxidants; about 4,000 are known. Different antioxidants are now known to function in a cooperative network. For example, Vitamin C can reactivate free radical-containing glutathione or Vitamin E by accepting the free radical itself. Some antioxidants are more effective than others at neutralizing different free radicals. Some cannot neutralize certain free radicals. Some cannot be present in certain areas of free radical development (Vitamin A is fat-soluble and protects fat areas, Vitamin C is water-soluble and protects those areas). When interacting with a free radical, some antioxidants produce a different free radical compound that is less dangerous or more dangerous than the previous compound. Having a variety of antioxidants allows any byproducts to be safely dealt with by more efficient antioxidants in neutralizing a free radical's butterfly effect."}]},"233":{"title":"Crimean_War","paragraphs":[]},"234":{"title":"Nonprofit_organization","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What are the two top types of NPOs?","id":"57276d82dd62a815002e9ca8","answers":[{"text":"membership and board-only","answer_start":50}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How is a membership organization run?","id":"57276d82dd62a815002e9ca9","answers":[{"text":"elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws","answer_start":103}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How is a board only organization run?","id":"57276d82dd62a815002e9caa","answers":[{"text":"self-selected board, and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board","answer_start":222}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is a further constraint of an NPO, depending on their legal structure?","id":"57276d82dd62a815002e9cab","answers":[{"text":"financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to its members\/directors is concerned","answer_start":1638}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What should one be aware of when dealing with a board run NPO?","id":"57276d82dd62a815002e9cac","answers":[{"text":"Board members who decide what percentage of your donations will increase their personal wealth are rampant in abusing this designation","answer_start":1852}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Fairvote and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws","answer_start":560}],"question":"What are two examples of a membership organization?","id":"5a455dc119a820001a1eda3e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"many complexities and requirements","answer_start":677}],"question":"What does the organization's literature impose on membership decision making?","id":"5a455dc119a820001a1eda3f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"board-only","answer_start":807}],"question":"What kind of structures have The National Association of Parliamentarians formed?","id":"5a455dc119a820001a1eda40","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the implications of this trend for the future of openness, accountability, and understanding of public concerns","answer_start":904}],"question":"What concerns do The National Association of Parliamentarians have about self-selected boards?","id":"5a455dc119a820001a1eda41","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"market discipline for products and shareholder discipline of their capital","answer_start":1147}],"question":"What do they note that an organizations bylaws are not subject to?","id":"5a455dc119a820001a1eda42","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The two major types of nonprofit organization are membership and board-only. A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws. A board-only organization typically has a self-selected board, and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board. A board-only organization's bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization's literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as \"members\"; examples of such organizations are Fairvote and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act imposes many complexities and requirements on membership decision-making. Accordingly, many organizations, such as Wikimedia, have formed board-only structures. The National Association of Parliamentarians has generated concerns about the implications of this trend for the future of openness, accountability, and understanding of public concerns in nonprofit organizations. Specifically, they note that nonprofit organizations, unlike business corporations, are not subject to market discipline for products and shareholder discipline of their capital; therefore, without membership control of major decisions such as election of the board, there are few inherent safeguards against abuse. A rebuttal to this might be that as nonprofit organizations grow and seek larger donations, the degree of scrutiny increases, including expectations of audited financial statements. A further rebuttal might be that NPOs are constrained, by their choice of legal structure, from financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to its members\/directors is concerned. Beware of board-only organizations- review the board members annual income before donating, such as the Clinton Foundation. Board members who decide what percentage of your donations will increase their personal wealth are rampant in abusing this designation of an NPO, and this is why they attempt to avoid audits and use a double bottom line for taxing."},{"qas":[{"question":"What problems with employment do Non Profits face?","id":"57278c025951b619008f8d0d","answers":[{"text":"Competition for employees with the public and private sector","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are positions that employees really want, but there are never enough of?","id":"57278c025951b619008f8d0e","answers":[{"text":"management","answer_start":148}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How important do NPOs consider hiring?","id":"57278c025951b619008f8d0f","answers":[{"text":"secondary priority","answer_start":328}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is a primary interest to prospective NPO employees?","id":"57278c025951b619008f8d10","answers":[{"text":"wage and benefits package","answer_start":674}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How do employees that are no longer with NPOs feel about the time that they worked there?","id":"57278c025951b619008f8d11","answers":[{"text":"stressful work environments and implacable work that drove them away","answer_start":785}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Competition for employees with the public and private sector","answer_start":0}],"question":"What is another problem public sector competitors face?","id":"5a45a19119a820001a1edac0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"management","answer_start":148}],"question":"In what area does the public sector need employees?","id":"5a45a19119a820001a1edac1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"major talent shortages","answer_start":191}],"question":"What kind of shortage is there in public companies today?","id":"5a45a19119a820001a1edac2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a secondary priority","answer_start":326}],"question":"What kind of priority do NPO's give to changing stressful work environments?","id":"5a45a19119a820001a1edac3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"stressful work environments and implacable work","answer_start":785}],"question":"What problems do public sector competitors have that drive away workers?","id":"5a45a19119a820001a1edac4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Competition for employees with the public and private sector is another problem that Nonprofit organizations will inevitably face, particularly for management positions.

The plot is for more than just entertainment purposes; within it lies information about economics, psychology, science, religions, politics, cultures, and social depth. Studying and analyzing literature becomes very important in terms of learning about our history. Through the study of past literature we are able to learn about how society has evolved and about the societal norms during each of the different periods all throughout history. This can even help us to understand references made in more modern literature because authors often make references to Greek mythology and other old religious texts or historical moments. Not only is there literature written on each of the aforementioned topics themselves, and how they have evolved throughout history (like a book about the history of economics or a book about evolution and science, for example) but we can also learn about these things in fictional works. Authors often include historical moments in their works, like when Lord Byron talks about the Spanish and the French in \u2018\u2018Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage: Canto I\u2019\u2019 and expresses his opinions through his character Childe Harold. Through literature we are able to continuously uncover new information about history. It is easy to see how all academic fields have roots in literature. Information became easier to pass down from generation to generation once we began to write it down. Eventually everything was written down, from things like home remedies and cures for illness, or how to build shelter to traditions and religious practices. From there people were able to study literature, improve on ideas, further our knowledge, and academic fields such as the medical field or trades could be started. In much the same way as the literature that we study today continue to be updated as we continue to evolve and learn more and more."},{"qas":[{"question":"Literature gives the reader insights into what areas of its characters?","id":"5726e512f1498d1400e8ef14","answers":[{"text":"intimate emotional aspects","answer_start":36}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How does literary fiction aid the person who reads it?","id":"5726e512f1498d1400e8ef15","answers":[{"text":"It benefits the psychological development and understanding","answer_start":124}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What writer's entry in \"The English Journal\" was concerned with young adult fiction?","id":"5726e512f1498d1400e8ef16","answers":[{"text":"D.

Ibn Sina seems to have declined the offers of Mahmud of Ghazni, and proceeded westwards to Urgench in modern Turkmenistan, where the vizier, regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of Nishapur and Merv to the borders of Khorasan, seeking an opening for his talents. Qabus, the generous ruler of Tabaristan, himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Ibn Sina himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at Gorgan, near the Caspian Sea, Ibn Sina met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Ibn Sina lectured on logic and astronomy. Several of Ibn Sina's treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his Canon of Medicine also dates from his stay in Hyrcania."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is one modality of being that Avicenna analyzed?","id":"5726d521f1498d1400e8ec8a","answers":[{"text":"necessity","answer_start":182}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"According to Avicenna, what could eventually be actualized by an external cause?","id":"5726d521f1498d1400e8ec8b","answers":[{"text":"contingency-in-itself","answer_start":521}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the necessary according to Avicenna?","id":"5726d521f1498d1400e8ec8c","answers":[{"text":"the source of its own being without borrowed existence","answer_start":908}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"According to Avicenna, what always exists?","id":"5726d521f1498d1400e8ec8d","answers":[{"text":"The necessary","answer_start":891}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"If necessary being is true in itself, what is contingent?","id":"5726d521f1498d1400e8ec8e","answers":[{"text":"false in itself","answer_start":822}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"necessity","answer_start":182}],"question":"What is one modality of being that Avicenna did not analyze?","id":"5ace5f6b32bba1001ae4a453","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Avicenna","answer_start":193}],"question":"Who argued that the impossible thing could exist?","id":"5ace5f6b32bba1001ae4a454","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"contingent in itself","answer_start":273}],"question":"What did Avicenna believe could never be actualized by an external cause?","id":"5ace5f6b32bba1001ae4a455","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"its own being","answer_start":922}],"question":"What is the necessary not a source of?","id":"5ace5f6b32bba1001ae4a456","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"necessity","answer_start":182}],"question":"What is one modality of being that Avicenna never analyzed?","id":"5acea0d232bba1001ae4adcb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"contingency-in-itself","answer_start":521}],"question":"According to Avicenna, what could eventually be actualized by an internal cause?","id":"5acea0d232bba1001ae4adcc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the source of its own being without borrowed existence","answer_start":908}],"question":"What is the unnecessary according to Avicenna?","id":"5acea0d232bba1001ae4adcd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The necessary","answer_start":891}],"question":"According to Avicenna, what never exists?","id":"5acea0d232bba1001ae4adce","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"false in itself","answer_start":822}],"question":"If necessary being is false in itself, what is contingent?","id":"5acea0d232bba1001ae4adcf","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Avicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity.

When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'.

Avicenna believed his \"Floating Man\" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have self-consciousness. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from sense experience, would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance. The conceivability of this \"Floating Man\" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human intelligence, particularly the active intellect, which he believed to be the hypostasis by which God communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature.

He discusses Aristotle's Posterior Analytics and significantly diverged from it on several points. Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of \"How does one acquire the first principles of a science?\" He asked how a scientist would arrive at \"the initial axioms or hypotheses of a deductive science without inferring them from some more basic premises?\" He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a \"relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty.\" Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the first principles: the ancient Aristotelian method of induction (istiqra), and the method of examination and experimentation (tajriba). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that \"it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide.\" In its place, he develops a \"method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry.\""},{"qas":[{"question":"What was a subject that Avicenna studied, but did not develop a theory on?","id":"5726f04add62a815002e95ce","answers":[{"text":"temporal logic","answer_start":26}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who expanded on Avicenna's work in temporal logic?","id":"5726f04add62a815002e95cf","answers":[{"text":"Najm al-D\u012bn al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b al-K\u0101tib\u012b","answer_start":245}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What became the dominant system of Islamic logic?","id":"5726f04add62a815002e95d0","answers":[{"text":"Avicennian logic","answer_start":346}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What European logician was greatly influenced by Avicenna?","id":"5726f04add62a815002e95d1","answers":[{"text":"Albertus Magnus","answer_start":420}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Whose law of noncontradiction did Avicenna endorse?","id":"5726f04add62a815002e95d2","answers":[{"text":"Aristotle","answer_start":517}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Avicenna","answer_start":56}],"question":"who studied and developed theories on temporal logic?","id":"5ace68d832bba1001ae4a5ed","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Najm al-D\u012bn al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b al-K\u0101tib\u012b","answer_start":245}],"question":"Who's system of logic did Avicenna further develop?","id":"5ace68d832bba1001ae4a5ee","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Najm al-D\u012bn al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b al-K\u0101tib\u012b","answer_start":245}],"question":"Who's system of logic is dominant in modern times?","id":"5ace68d832bba1001ae4a5ef","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Albertus Magnus and William of Ockham.","answer_start":420}],"question":"What European logicians did Avicennian logic borrow from?","id":"5ace68d832bba1001ae4a5f0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Avicenna","answer_start":459}],"question":"Whorefuted the law of noncontradiction?","id":"5ace68d832bba1001ae4a5f1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"temporal logic","answer_start":26}],"question":"What was a subject that Avicenna studied, and developed a theory on?","id":"5acea73b32bba1001ae4af0b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Najm al-D\u012bn al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b al-K\u0101tib\u012b","answer_start":245}],"question":"Who expanded on Avicenna's work in permanent logic?","id":"5acea73b32bba1001ae4af0c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Avicennian logic","answer_start":346}],"question":"What became the nondominant system of Islamic logic?","id":"5acea73b32bba1001ae4af0d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Albertus Magnus","answer_start":420}],"question":"What European magician was greatly influenced by Avicenna?","id":"5acea73b32bba1001ae4af0e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Aristotle","answer_start":517}],"question":"Whose law of contradiction did Avicenna endorse?","id":"5acea73b32bba1001ae4af0f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"An early formal system of temporal logic was studied by Avicenna.

Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body."},{"qas":[{"question":"What Muslim astronomer did Avicenna influence?","id":"5726f5565951b619008f8369","answers":[{"text":"Al-Biruni","answer_start":150}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What subject did Avicenna consider to be a separate discipline from astrology?","id":"5726f5565951b619008f836a","answers":[{"text":"mathematical astronomy","answer_start":219}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What philosopher thought the stars received their light from the sun?","id":"5726f5565951b619008f836b","answers":[{"text":"Aristotle","answer_start":295}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What planet did Aristotle think was a spot on the sun?","id":"5726f5565951b619008f836c","answers":[{"text":"Venus","answer_start":485}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where did Avicenna think Venus was in relation to the sun?","id":"5726f5565951b619008f836d","answers":[{"text":"below the Sun","answer_start":865}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Al-Biruni","answer_start":150}],"question":"What Muslim astrologer did Avicenna influence?","id":"5acea9b232bba1001ae4af57","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"mathematical astronomy","answer_start":219}],"question":"What subject did Avicenna consider to be a separate discipline from astronomy?","id":"5acea9b232bba1001ae4af58","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Aristotle","answer_start":295}],"question":"What philosopher thought the stars received their light from the moon?","id":"5acea9b232bba1001ae4af59","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Venus","answer_start":485}],"question":"What planet did Aristotle think was a spot on the moon?","id":"5acea9b232bba1001ae4af5a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"below the Sun","answer_start":865}],"question":"Where did Avicenna think Venus was in relation to the moon?","id":"5acea9b232bba1001ae4af5b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Avicenna's astronomical writings had some influence on later writers, although in general his work could be considered less developed than Alhazen or Al-Biruni.

He claimed to have observed Venus as a spot on the Sun. This is possible, as there was a transit on May 24, 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus.

The earliest surviving pieces written in regular script are copies of Yao's works, including at least one copied by Wang Xizhi. This new script, which is the dominant modern Chinese script, developed out of a neatly written form of early semi-cursive, with addition of the pause (\u9813\/\u987f d\u00f9n) technique to end horizontal strokes, plus heavy tails on strokes which are written to the downward-right diagonal. Thus, early regular script emerged from a neat, formal form of semi-cursive, which had itself emerged from neo-clerical (a simplified, convenient form of clerical script). It then matured further in the Eastern Jin dynasty in the hands of the \"Sage of Calligraphy\", Wang Xizhi, and his son Wang Xianzhi. It was not, however, in widespread use at that time, and most writers continued using neo-clerical, or a somewhat semi-cursive form of it, for daily writing, while the conservative bafen clerical script remained in use on some stelae, alongside some semi-cursive, but primarily neo-clerical."},{"qas":[{"question":"What contains four strokes?","id":"5726dc26708984140094d3e5","answers":[{"text":"right half of the character","answer_start":645}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What do some dictionaries have?","id":"5726dc26708984140094d3e6","answers":[{"text":"sub-index","answer_start":885}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What gives remaining stroke numbers?","id":"5726dc26708984140094d3e7","answers":[{"text":"sub-index","answer_start":536}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"For instance, to look up the character where the sound is not known, e.g., \u677e (pine tree), the user first determines which part of the character is the radical (here \u6728), then counts the number of strokes in the radical (four), and turns to the radical index (usually located on the inside front or back cover of the dictionary).

There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \"coloured\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority.

Europeans traded goods with peoples at the coast; coastal trade with Europeans also marked the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade. The port of Calabar on the historical Bight of Biafra (now commonly referred to as the Bight of Bonny) become one of the largest slave trading posts in West Africa in the era of the transatlantic slave trade. Other major slaving ports in Nigeria were located in Badagry, Lagos on the Bight of Benin and on Bonny Island on the Bight of Biafra. The majority of those enslaved and taken to these ports were captured in raids and wars. Usually the captives were taken back to the conquerors' territory as forced labour; after time, they were sometimes acculturated and absorbed into the conquerors' society. A number of slave routes were established throughout Nigeria linking the hinterland areas with the major coastal ports.

One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British\u2013French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British\u2013French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions."}]},"242":{"title":"Capacitor","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What benefit is offered by solid state paper capacitors?","id":"572711cff1498d1400e8f30a","answers":[{"text":"relatively high voltage performance","answer_start":157}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of capacitor has mostly replaced solid state paper capacitors?","id":"572711cff1498d1400e8f30b","answers":[{"text":"plastic film capacitors","answer_start":275}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What sort of circuit are plastic capacitors especially useful for?","id":"572711cff1498d1400e8f30c","answers":[{"text":"timer circuits","answer_start":383}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is one type of reliable capacitor that is resistant to temperature and voltage changes?","id":"572711cff1498d1400e8f30d","answers":[{"text":"Glass","answer_start":821}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is another type of reliable capacitor that is resistant to temperature and voltage changes?","id":"572711cff1498d1400e8f30e","answers":[{"text":"mica capacitors","answer_start":831}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"relatively high voltage performance","answer_start":157}],"question":" What benefit is never offered by solid state paper capacitors?","id":"5acf67fb77cf76001a684d94","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"plastic film capacitors","answer_start":275}],"question":" What type of capacitor has not replaced solid state paper capacitors?","id":"5acf67fb77cf76001a684d95","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"timer circuits","answer_start":383}],"question":" What sort of circuit are plastic capacitors not useful for?","id":"5acf67fb77cf76001a684d96","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Glass","answer_start":821}],"question":"What is one type of reliable capacitor that is non-resistant to temperature and voltage changes?","id":"5acf67fb77cf76001a684d97","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"mica capacitors","answer_start":831}],"question":" What is another type of reliable capacitor that is not resistant to temperature and voltage changes?","id":"5acf67fb77cf76001a684d98","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Several solid dielectrics are available, including paper, plastic, glass, mica and ceramic materials. Paper was used extensively in older devices and offers relatively high voltage performance. However, it is susceptible to water absorption, and has been largely replaced by plastic film capacitors. Plastics offer better stability and ageing performance, which makes them useful in timer circuits, although they may be limited to low operating temperatures and frequencies. Ceramic capacitors are generally small, cheap and useful for high frequency applications, although their capacitance varies strongly with voltage and they age poorly. They are broadly categorized as class 1 dielectrics, which have predictable variation of capacitance with temperature or class 2 dielectrics, which can operate at higher voltage. Glass and mica capacitors are extremely reliable, stable and tolerant to high temperatures and voltages, but are too expensive for most mainstream applications. Electrolytic capacitors and supercapacitors are used to store small and larger amounts of energy, respectively, ceramic capacitors are often used in resonators, and parasitic capacitance occurs in circuits wherever the simple conductor-insulator-conductor structure is formed unintentionally by the configuration of the circuit layout."},{"qas":[{"question":"What happens to the current when an inductive circuit is opened?","id":"572721a4708984140094da49","answers":[{"text":"the current through the inductance collapses quickly","answer_start":37}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happens to the voltage when an inductive circuit is opened?","id":"572721a4708984140094da4a","answers":[{"text":"a large voltage across the open circuit of the switch","answer_start":100}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of capacitor is used to make a path to bypass the contact points?","id":"572721a4708984140094da4b","answers":[{"text":"A snubber capacitor","answer_start":349}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is a typical system in which a snubber capacitor is found?","id":"572721a4708984140094da4c","answers":[{"text":"contact breaker ignition systems","answer_start":523}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of capacitor absorbs radio frequency interference?","id":"572721a4708984140094da4d","answers":[{"text":"a filter capacitor","answer_start":735}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"inductance collapses quickly","answer_start":61}],"question":" What happens to the current when an inductive circuit is closed?","id":"5acf7dab77cf76001a684f70","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"large voltage across the open circuit of the switch","answer_start":102}],"question":" What happens to the voltage when an inductive circuit is closed?","id":"5acf7dab77cf76001a684f71","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"A snubber capacitor","answer_start":349}],"question":"What type of capacitor is used to make a path to not bypass the contact points?","id":"5acf7dab77cf76001a684f72","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"contact breaker ignition systems","answer_start":523}],"question":" What is a typical system in which a snubber capacitor is not found?","id":"5acf7dab77cf76001a684f73","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"filter capacitor absorbs","answer_start":737}],"question":" What type of capacitor dispenses radio frequency interference?","id":"5acf7dab77cf76001a684f74","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"When an inductive circuit is opened, the current through the inductance collapses quickly, creating a large voltage across the open circuit of the switch or relay. If the inductance is large enough, the energy will generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the main winding on a squirrel cage motor capable of withstanding?","id":"572722c0708984140094da53","answers":[{"text":"a rotational motion on the rotor","answer_start":110}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What sort of capacitors are used on the second winding of a squirrel cage motor?","id":"572722c0708984140094da54","answers":[{"text":"series non-polarized starting capacitor","answer_start":232}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does the capacitor on the second winding of a squirrel cage motor do?","id":"572722c0708984140094da55","answers":[{"text":"introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current","answer_start":275}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does the centrifugal switch do the capacitor when the rotor achieves operating speed?","id":"572722c0708984140094da56","answers":[{"text":"disconnects the capacitor","answer_start":684}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where is the start capacitor commonly mounted?","id":"572722c0708984140094da57","answers":[{"text":"to the side of the motor housing","answer_start":752}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"rotational motion on the rotor","answer_start":112}],"question":"What is the main winding on a squirrel cage motor capable of withstanding?","id":"5acf8ff377cf76001a685276","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"series non-polarized starting capacitor","answer_start":232}],"question":"What sort of capacitors are never used on the second winding of a squirrel cage motor?","id":"5acf8ff377cf76001a685277","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"capacitor-start motors","answer_start":803}],"question":"What doesn't the capacitor on the second winding of a squirrel cage motor do?","id":"5acf8ff377cf76001a685278","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the side of the motor","answer_start":755}],"question":" Where is the start capacitor commonly mounted?","id":"5acf8ff377cf76001a685279","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In single phase squirrel cage motors, the primary winding within the motor housing is not capable of starting a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary \"start\" winding has a series non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current. When the secondary (start) winding is placed at an angle with respect to the primary (run) winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted to the side of the motor housing. These are called capacitor-start motors, that have relatively high starting torque.

(Tamers\u2019 only human connection to the Adventure series is Ryo Akiyama, a character featured in some of the Digimon video games and who made an appearance in some occasions of the Adventure story-line.) Some of the changes in this series include the way the Digimon digivolve with the introduction of Biomerge-Digivolution and the way their \"Digivices\" work. In this series, the Tamers can slide game cards through their \"Digivices\" and give their Digimon partners certain advantages, as in the card game. This act is called \"Digi-Modify\" (Card Slash in the Japanese version). The same process was often used to Digivolve the Digimon, but as usual, emotions play a big part in the digivolving process. Unlike the two seasons before it and most of the seasons that followed, Digimon Tamers takes a darker and more realistic approach to its story featuring Digimon who do not reincarnate after their deaths and more complex character development in the original Japanese. The anime has become controversial over the decade, with debates about how appropriate this show actually is for its \"target\" audience, especially due to the Lovecraftian nature of the last arc. The English dub is more lighthearted dialogue-wise, though still not as much as previous series."},{"qas":[{"question":"How long did Digimon stay off the air before returning?","id":"572a2c616aef051400155338","answers":[{"text":"three-year hiatus","answer_start":8}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What year did the fifth  series start?","id":"572a2c616aef051400155339","answers":[{"text":"April 2, 2006","answer_start":66}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the main focus of the 5th season?","id":"572a2c616aef05140015533a","answers":[{"text":"D.A.T.S.

Like Frontier, Savers has no connection with the previous installments, and also marks a new start for the Digimon franchise, with a drastic change in character designs and story-line, in order to reach a broader audience. The story focuses on the challenges faced by the members of D.A.T.S. (\"Digital Accident Tactics Squad\"), an organization created to conceal the existence of the Digital World and Digimon from the rest of mankind, and secretly solve any Digimon-related incidents occurring on Earth. Later the D.A.T.S. is dragged into a massive conflict between Earth and the Digital World, triggered by an ambitious human scientist named Akihiro Kurata, determined to make use of the Digimon for his own personal gains. The English version was dubbed by Studiopolis and it premiered on the Jetix block on Toon Disney on October 1, 2007. Digivolution in Data Squad requires the human partner's DNA (\"Digital Natural Ability\" in the English version and \"Digisoul\" in the Japanese version) to activate, a strong empathy with their Digimon and a will to succeed. 'Digimon Savers' also introduces a new form of digivolving called Burst Mode which is essentially the level above Mega (previously the strongest form a digimon could take). Like previously in Tamers, this plot takes on a dark tone throughout the story and the anime was aimed, originally in Japan, at an older audience consisting of late teens and people in their early twenties from ages 16 to 21. Because of that, along with the designs, the anime being heavily edited and localized for western US audiences like past series, and the English dub being aimed mostly toward younger audiences of children aged 6 to 10 and having a lower TV-Y7-FV rating just like past dubs, Studiopolis dubbed the anime on Jetix with far more edits, changes, censorship, and cut footage. This included giving the Japanese characters full Americanized names and American surnames as well as applying far more Americanization (Marcus Damon as opposed to the Japanese Daimon Masaru), cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4Kids often made (such as removal of Japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining). Despite all that, the setting of the country was still in Japan and the characters were Japanese in the dub. This series was the first to show any Japanese cultural concepts that were unfamiliar with American audiences (such as the manju), which were left unedited and used in the English dub. Also despite the heavy censorship and the English dub aimed at young children, some of the Digimon's attacks named after real weapons such as RizeGreymon's Trident Revolver are not edited and used in the English dub. Well Go USA released it on DVD instead of Disney. The North American English dub was televised on Jetix in the U.S. and on the Family Channel in Canada."}]},"245":{"title":"Glacier","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What characteristics determine glacial zones?","id":"5726ffac5951b619008f844f","answers":[{"text":"surface snowpack and melt conditions","answer_start":40}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which glacial zone area reports a net-loss in glacial mass?","id":"5726ffac5951b619008f8450","answers":[{"text":"ablation zone","answer_start":82}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of the line seperating the ablation zone from the accumulation zone?","id":"5726ffac5951b619008f8451","answers":[{"text":"equilibrium line","answer_start":157}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much glacial surface area is typically considered accumulation zone?","id":"5726ffac5951b619008f8452","answers":[{"text":"60\u201370%","answer_start":499}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"zones","answer_start":25}],"question":"What is based on suface ice and melt conditions?","id":"5a359966788daf001a5f862c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"equilibrium line","answer_start":157}],"question":"Wht line marks the center of the glacier?","id":"5a359966788daf001a5f862d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the glacier's surface area","answer_start":509}],"question":"What does the abilation zone cover 60-70% of?","id":"5a359966788daf001a5f862e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"downward force","answer_start":629}],"question":"What forces underlying rock upward?","id":"5a359966788daf001a5f862f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Great Lakes","answer_start":808}],"question":"What lakes where formed from a mountain depression","id":"5a359966788daf001a5f8630","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Glaciers are broken into zones based on surface snowpack and melt conditions.

The upper part of a glacier, where accumulation exceeds ablation, is called the accumulation zone. In general, the accumulation zone accounts for 60\u201370% of the glacier's surface area, more if the glacier calves icebergs. Ice in the accumulation zone is deep enough to exert a downward force that erodes underlying rock.

Wagner of New York, the Wagner Act was in line with President Roosevelt's goal of providing economic security to workers and other low-income groups. During this time period it was not uncommon for employers to blacklist or fire employees associated with unions. The Wagner Act allowed workers to unionize without fear of being discriminated against, and empowered a National Labor Relations Board to review potential cases of worker discrimination. In the event of discrimination, employees were to be restored to an appropriate status in the company through 'affirmative action'. While the Wagner Act protected workers and unions it did not protect minorities, who, exempting the Congress of Industrial Organizations, were often barred from union ranks.:11 This original coining of the term therefore has little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today, but helped set the stage for all policy meant to compensate or address an individual's unjust treatment.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"The \"To Secure These Rights\" findings wanted desegregation of which institution?","id":"57272c57708984140094daa1","answers":[{"text":"Armed

They also struggled with many of the same school segregation laws that African Americans faced. Particularly, during World War II, Japanese Americans were interned in camps and lost their property, homes, and businesses. Discrimination against Asians began with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and then continued with the Scott Act of 1888 and the Geary Act of 1892. At the beginning of the 20th century, the United States passed the Immigration Act of 1924 to prevent Asian immigration out of fear that Asians were stealing white jobs and lowering the standard for wages. In addition, whites and non-Asians do not differentiate among the different Asian groups and perpetuate the \"model minority\" stereotype. According to a 2010 article by Professor Qin Zhang of Fairfield University, Asians are characterized as one dimensional in having great work ethic and valuing education, but lacking in communication skills and personality. A negative outcome of this stereotype is that Asians have been portrayed as having poor leadership and interpersonal skills. This has contributing to the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon in which although there are many qualified Asian Americans, they occupy a disproportionately small number of executive positions in businesses. Furthermore, the model minority stereotype has led to resentment of Asian success and several universities and colleges have limited or have been accused of limiting Asian matriculation."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which President made their stance on affirmative action clear in 1995?","id":"57274387f1498d1400e8f560","answers":[{"text":"Bill Clinton","answer_start":266}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How long after his inauguration was Bill Clinton's speech?","id":"57274387f1498d1400e8f561","answers":[{"text":"two and a half years","answer_start":375}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which speech did Bill Clinton's speech draw parallels to?","id":"57274387f1498d1400e8f562","answers":[{"text":"President Lyndon B.

For example, opponents say affirmative action causes unprepared applicants to be accepted in highly demanding educational institutions or jobs which result in eventual failure (see, for example, Richard Sander's study of affirmative action in Law School, bar exam and eventual performance at law firms).

In this view, admission is not an honor bestowed to reward superior merit but rather a way to advance the mission as each university defines it.

Texas banning any use of race in school admissions, the State of Texas passed a law guaranteeing entry to any state university if a student finished in the top 10% of their graduating class. Florida and California have also replaced racial quotas with class rank and other criteria. Class rank tends to benefit top students at less competitive high schools, to the detriment of students at more competitive high schools. This effect, however, may be intentional since less-funded, less competitive schools are more likely to be schools where minority enrollment is high. Critics argue that class rank is more a measure of one's peers than of one's self. The top 10% rule adds racial diversity only because schools are still highly racially segregated because of residential patterns. The class rank rule has the same consequence as traditional affirmative action: opening schools to students who would otherwise not be admitted had the given school used a holistic, merit-based approach. From 1996 to 1998, Texas had merit-based admission to its state universities, and minority enrollment dropped. The state's adoption of the \"top 10 percent\" rule returned minority enrollment to pre-1996 levels."},{"qas":[{"question":"With which organization did Li file a civil rights complaint?","id":"57276ad1dd62a815002e9c8a","answers":[{"text":"Office for Civil Rights","answer_start":102}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which university was Li alleging racial discrimination against?","id":"57276ad1dd62a815002e9c8b","answers":[{"text":"Princeton University","answer_start":134}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was the Dean of Admissions at Princeton University at the time of the complaint?","id":"57276ad1dd62a815002e9c8c","answers":[{"text":"Janet Rapelye","answer_start":477}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did Princeton claim the real reasons for the rejection of Li's application was?","id":"57276ad1dd62a815002e9c8d","answers":[{"text":"many others had far better qualifications","answer_start":679}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Even though Li did not get accepted, what was done instead of a straight rejection?","id":"57276ad1dd62a815002e9c8e","answers":[{"text":"placement on the waitlist","answer_start":843}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Office for Civil Rights against","answer_start":102}],"question":" With which organization did Li not file a civil rights complaint?","id":"5ad41add604f3c001a4004f1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Princeton University","answer_start":134}],"question":" Which university was Li allegingn non-racial discrimination against?","id":"5ad41add604f3c001a4004f2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Janet Rapelye","answer_start":477}],"question":"Who wasn't the Dean of Admissions at Princeton University at the time of the complaint?","id":"5ad41add604f3c001a4004f3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"many others had far better qualifications","answer_start":679}],"question":" What did Princeton claim the real reasons for the approval of Li's application was?","id":"5ad41add604f3c001a4004f4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"waitlisted","answer_start":922}],"question":"Even though Li did not get rejected, what was done instead of a straight rejection?","id":"5ad41add604f3c001a4004f5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In 2006, Jian Li, a Chinese undergraduate at Yale University, filed a civil rights complaint with the Office for Civil Rights against Princeton University, claiming that his race played a role in their decision to reject his application for admission and seeking the suspension of federal financial assistance to the university until it \"discontinues discrimination against Asian Americans in all forms\" by eliminating race and legacy preferences.

Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian\u2013Alemannic Fastnacht. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift is eternal life in heaven and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life. Besides Christian anti-Judaism, the commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root. Christ's passion is itself grotesque: Since early Christianity Christ is figured as the victim of summary judgement, is tortured and executed by Romans before a Jewish mob (\"His blood is on us and on our children!\" Matthew 27:24\u201325). Holy Week processions in Spain include crowds who vociferously insult the figure of Jesus. Irreverence, parody, degradation and laughter at a tragicomic effigy God can be seen as intensifications of the sacred order. In 1466, the Catholic Church under Pope Paul II revieved customs of the Saturnalia carnival: Jews were forced to race naked through the streets of the city of Rome. \u201cBefore they were to run, the Jews were richly fed, so as to make the race more difficult for them and at the same time more amusing for spectators.

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860.

Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of Origin, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection.

Darwin borrowed Charles Lyell's argument in Principles of Geology that the record is extremely imperfect as fossilisation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of geological formations, and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms. To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he again cited Principles of Geology and other observations based on sedimentation and erosion, including an estimate that erosion of The Weald had taken 300 million years. The initial appearance of entire groups of well developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the Cambrian explosion, posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils.

The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited Richard Owen's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing.

In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \"Great Hippocampus Question\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \"great hippopotamus test\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains.

It is the highest judicial instance. The Supreme Court sits in Jerusalem. The area of its jurisdiction is the entire State.

As an appellate court, the Supreme Court considers cases on appeal (both criminal and civil) on judgments and other decisions of the District Courts. It also considers appeals on judicial and quasi-judicial decisions of various kinds, such as matters relating to the legality of Knesset elections and disciplinary rulings of the Bar Association.

The court has broad discretionary authority to rule on matters in which it considers it necessary to grant relief in the interests of justice, and which are not within the jurisdiction of another court or tribunal. The High Court of Justice grants relief through orders such as injunction, mandamus and Habeas Corpus, as well as through declaratory judgments. The Supreme Court can also sit at a further hearing on its own judgment. In a matter on which the Supreme Court has ruled - whether as a court of appeals or as the High Court of Justice - with a panel of three or more justices, it may rule at a further hearing with a panel of a larger number of justices. A further hearing may be held if the Supreme Court makes a ruling inconsistent with a previous ruling or if the Court deems that the importance, difficulty or novelty of a ruling of the Court justifies such hearing. The Supreme Court also holds the unique power of being able to order \"trial de novo\" (a retrial)."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the highest court in Brazil?","id":"57278cb9f1498d1400e8fbb2","answers":[{"text":"Supreme Federal Tribunal (Supremo Tribunal Federal)","answer_start":15}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are the two areas this court has supremacy over?","id":"57278cb9f1498d1400e8fbb3","answers":[{"text":"cases that may be unconstitutional or final habeas corpus pleads for criminal cases","answer_start":188}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which legislative bodies does this court sit in cases over?","id":"57278cb9f1498d1400e8fbb4","answers":[{"text":"cases involving members of congress, senators","answer_start":315}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What other government officials are subject to judgments of Brazil's highest court?","id":"57278cb9f1498d1400e8fbb5","answers":[{"text":"ministers of state, members of the high courts and the President and Vice-President of the Republic","answer_start":362}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is Brazil's high court for labor law?","id":"57278cb9f1498d1400e8fbb6","answers":[{"text":"The Superior Labour Tribunal (Tribunal Superior do Trabalho)","answer_start":667}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"general elections","answer_start":890}],"question":"The Superior Labour Tribunal oversees what type of elections?","id":"5a7fb0f18f0597001ac0007b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"cases that may be unconstitutional or final habeas corpus pleads for criminal cases","answer_start":188}],"question":"What two types of cases does the Superior Military Tribunal only review?","id":"5a7fb0f18f0597001ac0007c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"rulings","answer_start":658}],"question":"What conflicting outcomes does the Superior Electoral Tribunal deal with?","id":"5a7fb0f18f0597001ac0007d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Supremo Tribunal Federal","answer_start":41}],"question":"What is the Brazilian name for the Supreme Court?","id":"5a7fb0f18f0597001ac0007e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In Brazil, the Supreme Federal Tribunal (Supremo Tribunal Federal) is the highest court.

At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition.

Berliner's earliest discs, first marketed in 1889, but only in Europe, were 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter, and were played with a small hand-propelled machine. Both the records and the machine were adequate only for use as a toy or curiosity, due to the limited sound quality. In the United States in 1894, under the Berliner Gramophone trademark, Berliner started marketing records with somewhat more substantial entertainment value, along with somewhat more substantial gramophones to play them. Berliner's records had poor sound quality compared to wax cylinders, but his manufacturing associate Eldridge R. Johnson eventually improved the sound quality. Abandoning Berliner's \"Gramophone\" trademark for legal reasons, in 1901 Johnson's and Berliner's separate companies reorganized to form the Victor Talking Machine Company, whose products would come to dominate the market for many years. Emile Berliner moved his company to Montreal in 1900. The factory which became RCA Victor stills exists.

In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success. Thin, flexible plastic records such as the German Phonycord and the British Filmophone and Goodson records appeared around 1930 but also did not last long. The contemporary French Path\u00e9 Cellodiscs, made of a very thin black plastic, which uncannily resembles the vinyl \"sound sheet\" magazine inserts of the 1965\u20131985 era, were similarly short-lived. In the US, Hit of the Week records, made of a patented translucent plastic called Durium coated on a heavy brown paper base, were introduced in early 1930. A new issue came out every week and they were sold at newsstands like a weekly magazine. Although inexpensive and commercially successful at first, they soon fell victim to the Great Depression and production in the US ended in 1932. Related Durium records continued to be made somewhat later in the UK and elsewhere, and as remarkably late as 1950 in Italy, where the name \"Durium\" survived far into the LP era as a trademark on ordinary vinyl records.

Eddie Condon explained: \"Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development.\" The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length: \"Carnegie Drag\" was 3:15; \"Carnegie Jump\", 2:41. But at the second session, on April 30, the two 12-inch recordings were longer: \"Embraceable You\" was 4:05; \"Serenade to a Shylock\", 4:32. Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record. Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded \"Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean\", written by Irving and Jack Kaufman, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo. An obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records. An early multi-record release was in 1903, when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera, Verdi's Ernani, on 40 single-sided discs. In 1940, Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band's recording of \"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\" in four parts, issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s. This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record, in 1948. In popular music, this time limitation of about 3:30 on a 10-inch 78 rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record. One exception is Frank Sinatra's recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Soliloquy\", from Carousel, made on May 28, 1946. Because it ran 7:57, longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10-inch record, it was released on Columbia's Masterwork label (the classical division) as two sides of a 12-inch record. The same was true of John Raitt's performance of the song on the original cast album of Carousel, which had been issued on a 78-rpm album set by American Decca in 1945."},{"qas":[{"question":"What company out of Japan offered laser turntables that read vinyl discs optically?","id":"5727cd6e2ca10214002d96c6","answers":[{"text":"ELPJ","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was a benedit of laser read discs?","id":"5727cd6e2ca10214002d96c7","answers":[{"text":"eliminates record wear","answer_start":151}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was a drawback of laser read discs?","id":"5727cd6e2ca10214002d96c8","answers":[{"text":"degrade the sound","answer_start":225}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the primary use of laser read discs?","id":"5727cd6e2ca10214002d96c9","answers":[{"text":"archiving of analog records","answer_start":292}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was a major issue for laser read discs?","id":"5727cd6e2ca10214002d96ca","answers":[{"text":"dust","answer_start":544}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"ELPJ, a Japanese-based company, sells a laser turntable that uses a laser to read vinyl discs optically, without physical contact.

On some recordings (for example Sgt.

Automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of the arm, as it reaches the wider spacing in the groove, to trigger a mechanism that lifts the arm off the record.

The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a \"metallic soap,\" containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut \"wax\" sound discs would be placed in a vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual \"plating\" of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, \"matrix\" or \"father.\" The \"father\" is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a \"mother\". Many mothers can be grown on a single \"father\" before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The \"mothers\" are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as \"sons\". Each \"mother\" can be used to make many \"sons\" before deteriorating. The \"sons\" are then converted into \"stampers\" by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the \"father\"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a \"son\" (for each side), the \"father\" is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the \"two-step-process\" (as it does not entail creation of \"sons\" but does involve creation of \"mothers,\" which are used for test playing and kept as \"safeties\" for electroforming future \"sons\") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The \"sons\" made during a \"three-step\" electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than \"fathers\"."},{"qas":[{"question":"What causes clicks and pops on vinyl records?","id":"5727e4fd2ca10214002d98ea","answers":[{"text":"Dust and scratches","answer_start":174}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the cause of lock grooves on vinyl records?","id":"5727e4fd2ca10214002d98eb","answers":[{"text":"Dust and scratches","answer_start":174}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does the saying \"Like a broken record\" originate?","id":"5727e4fd2ca10214002d98ec","answers":[{"text":"locked groove","answer_start":362}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How easily do vinyl records break?","id":"5727e4fd2ca10214002d98ed","answers":[{"text":"Vinyl records do not break easily","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is a common damage to vinyl records?","id":"5727e4fd2ca10214002d98ee","answers":[{"text":"easily scratched.","answer_start":60}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Vinyl records do not break easily, but the soft material is easily scratched.

The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of 1912 and George Wallace in the election of 1968). As third party movements have learned, the Electoral College's requirement of a nationally distributed majority makes it difficult for third parties to succeed. Thus, such parties rarely win many electoral votes, although their popular support within a state may tip it toward one party or the other. Wallace had weak support outside the South. More generally, parties with a broad base of support across regions or among economic and other interest groups, have a great chance of winning the necessary plurality in the U.S.'s largely single-member district, winner-take-all elections.

This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious \u2013 discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, post World War II France and Italy being prime examples. When one party in a two-party system controls all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances, as were Republicans as far removed in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.

The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella polyphony had further developed, but gradually, the cantata began to take the place of a cappella forms. 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ \"doubling\" some or all of the voices. Such is seen in the life of Palestrina becoming a major influence on Bach, most notably in the aforementioned Mass in B Minor. Other composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were Claudio Monteverdi and his masterpiece, Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which was composed in 1610, and Andrea Gabrieli when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style. Learning from the preceding two composeres, Heinrich Sch\u00fctz utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces in the oratorio style, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ's suffering and the Passion. Five of Schutz's Historien were Easter pieces, and of these the latter three, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of Matthew, Luke and John, were all done a cappella style. This was a near requirement for this type of piece, and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a plainchant."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the previous name of oldest recorded college a cappella group?","id":"5727bd833acd2414000deb1d","answers":[{"text":"RPI Glee Club","answer_start":135}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What prominent composer was once a member of The Whiffenpoofs?","id":"5727bd833acd2414000deb1e","answers":[{"text":"Cole Porter","answer_start":384}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of the a capella group that was a parody of The Whiffenpoofs?","id":"5727bd833acd2414000deb1f","answers":[{"text":"the Smiffenpoofs of Smith College","answer_start":999}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of the college a capella event that's been held since 1975?","id":"5727bd833acd2414000deb20","answers":[{"text":"Georgetown Chimes' Cherry Tree Massacre","answer_start":1561}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What well-known musician was once part of the college a capella group The Counterparts?","id":"5727bd833acd2414000deb21","answers":[{"text":"John Legend","answer_start":1916}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Cole Porter","answer_start":384}],"question":"Who was formerly a member of The Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute?","id":"5a304eb5f1f7c7001ab92d58","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University","answer_start":304}],"question":"What group was formed in 1873 and is is the longest continually singing group?","id":"5a304eb5f1f7c7001ab92d59","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"throughout the 20th century","answer_start":443}],"question":"During what time period did continuously-singing groups grow?","id":"5a304eb5f1f7c7001ab92d5a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the men's groups","answer_start":981}],"question":"What were The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University often a parody of?","id":"5a304eb5f1f7c7001ab92d5b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"beginning in the 1990s","answer_start":1196}],"question":"When did women's groups popularity explode?","id":"5a304eb5f1f7c7001ab92d5c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"It is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began. The Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.[citation needed] However the longest continuously-singing group is probably The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which was formed in 1909 and once included Cole Porter as a member. Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include Princeton University's Tigertones (1946), Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956). All-women a cappella groups followed shortly, frequently as a parody of the men's groups: the Smiffenpoofs of Smith College (1936), The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The She-Whiffenpoofs, 1944), and The Chattertocks of Brown University (1951). A cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s, fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the Tufts University Beelzebubs and the Boston University Dear Abbeys. The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including vocal percussion\/\"beatboxing\". Some larger universities now have multiple groups. Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as the Georgetown Chimes' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as International Quartet Champions The Boston Common and the contemporary commercial a cappella group Rockapella. Co-ed groups have produced many up-and-coming and major artists, including John Legend, an alumnus of the Counterparts at the University of Pennsylvania, and Sara Bareilles, an alumna of Awaken A Cappella at University of California, Los Angeles.

The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received \"significant\" financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge. Little said that, in the short term, he wanted to ensure that around 320 pupils per year receive bursaries, and that 70 were educated free of charge, with the intention that the number of pupils receiving financial assistance would continue to increase. These comparatively new developments will run alongside long-established courses that Eton has provided for pupils from state schools, most of them in the summer holidays (July and August). Launched in 1982, the Universities Summer School is an intensive residential course open to boys and girls throughout the UK who attend state schools, are at the end of their first year in the Sixth Form, and are about to begin their final year of schooling. The Brent-Eton Summer School, started in 1994, offers 40-50 young people from the London Borough of Brent, an area of inner-city deprivation, an intensive one-week residential course, free of charge, designed to help bridge the gap between GCSE and A-level. In 2008, Eton helped found the Eton, Slough, Windsor and Hounslow Independent and State School Partnership (ISSP), with six local state schools. The ISSP's aims are \"to raise pupil achievement, improve pupil self-esteem, raise pupil aspirations and improve professional practice across the schools\".

Under the provisions of the Charities Act 2006, it is now an excepted charity, and fully registered with the Charities Commission, and is now one of the 100 largest charities in the UK. As a charity, it benefits from substantial tax breaks. It was calculated by the late David Jewell, former Master of Haileybury, that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the School about \u00a31,945 per pupil per year, although he had no direct connection with the School. This subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the Labour Government of state-funded scholarships (formerly known as \"assisted places\") to independent schools.

Its topographic and climatic conditions have made animal husbandry and farming the primary source of Galicia's wealth for most of its history. With the exception of shipbuilding and food processing, Galicia was largely a semi-subsistence farming and fishing economy and did not experience significant industrialization until after the mid-20th century. In 2012, the gross domestic product at purchasing power parity was \u20ac56,000 million, with a nominal GDP per capita of \u20ac20,700. The population is largely concentrated in two coastal areas: from Ferrol to A Coru\u00f1a in the northwest and from Pontevedra to Vigo in the southwest. To a lesser extent, there are smaller populations around the interior cities of Lugo, Ourense and Santiago de Compostela. The political capital is Santiago de Compostela, in the province of A Coru\u00f1a. Vigo, in the province of Pontevedra, is the most populous municipality with 294,997 (2014), while A Coru\u00f1a is the most populous city with 215.227 (2014)."},{"qas":[{"question":"Along with Galicia's, which other two province's autonomy was annulled?","id":"5727c45a2ca10214002d95ca","answers":[{"text":"Catalonia and the Basque provinces","answer_start":498}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Under the control of whose army was Galicia under during this war?","id":"5727c45a2ca10214002d95cb","answers":[{"text":"Franco's","answer_start":186}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which prominent journalist was victim of the killings?","id":"5727c45a2ca10214002d95cc","answers":[{"text":"Manuel Lustres Rivas","answer_start":1483}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which admiral who hadn't joined the rebellion was also a victim?","id":"5727c45a2ca10214002d95cd","answers":[{"text":"Antonio Azarola","answer_start":1316}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Galicia was spared the worst of the fighting in that war: it was one of the areas where the initial coup attempt at the outset of the war was successful, and it remained in Nationalist (Franco's army's) hands throughout the war.

As the field developed it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film\/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and\/or gender.[citation needed] Cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. This field studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice. Recently, as capitalism has spread throughout the world (a process called globalization), cultural studies has begun[when?] to analyze local and global forms of resistance to Western hegemony.[citation needed] Globalization in this context can be defined as western civilization in other ways, it undermines the cultural integrity of other culture and it is therefore repressive, exploitative and harmful to most people in different places."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which two wrote Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition?","id":"57281099ff5b5019007d9c42","answers":[{"text":"Lindlof and Taylor","answer_start":22}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"From a Marxist view, what did they believe had to be controlled  to essentially control a culture?","id":"57281099ff5b5019007d9c43","answers":[{"text":"the economic base","answer_start":1035}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Lindlof and Taylor","answer_start":22}],"question":"Which two wrote Cultural studies are grounded in a rationalist, conservative-pluralist tradition?","id":"5a39b0472f14dd001ac7258d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the economic base","answer_start":1035}],"question":"What did they believe was unnecessary to control a culture from a Marxist view?","id":"5a39b0472f14dd001ac7258e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"art historian Griselda Pollock","answer_start":1766}],"question":"Who contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of art news and philosophy?","id":"5a39b0472f14dd001ac7258f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Julia Kristeva","answer_start":1891}],"question":"Which writer contributed to cultural studies from the field of science and French modernism?","id":"5a39b0472f14dd001ac72590","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"feminist cultural studies","answer_start":1148}],"question":"What never criticized the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product?","id":"5a39b0472f14dd001ac72591","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, \"Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition\". The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, mass culture; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of fandom.[citation needed] The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.[citation needed] Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a Marxist model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the Frankfurt School, but especially from the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the production of meaning. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies power as residing with those producing cultural artifacts. In a Marxist view, those who control the means of production (the economic base) essentially control a culture.[citation needed] Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman (by Paul du Gay et al.), which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist and art historian Griselda Pollock contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of art history and psychoanalysis. The writer Julia Kristeva is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical French feminism.[citation needed]"}]},"277":{"title":"Sahara","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What is the largest hottest continuously large area   worldwide?","id":"5728c4163acd2414000dfddf","answers":[{"text":"the Great Desert","answer_start":602}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the value temperature of most of the desert?","id":"5728c4163acd2414000dfde0","answers":[{"text":"25 \u00b0C","answer_start":2601}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What percent of time is the sun generally over most of the   desert?","id":"5728c4163acd2414000dfde1","answers":[{"text":"82% of the time","answer_start":192}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the annual average direct solar irradiation?","id":"5728c4163acd2414000dfde2","answers":[{"text":"around 2,800 kWh\/(m2 year)","answer_start":572}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"During daytime how high can the temperatures reach?","id":"5728c4163acd2414000dfde3","answers":[{"text":"80 \u00b0C (176 \u00b0F)","answer_start":2750}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"bright sunshine","answer_start":159}],"question":"What does the eastern desert get 3600 annual hours of?","id":"5a4c4cfc7a6c4c001a2bbbda","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"4,300 h","answer_start":411}],"question":"How much bright sunlight does lower Egypt recieve?","id":"5a4c4cfc7a6c4c001a2bbbdb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"solar energy","answer_start":656}],"question":"What type of energy production is difficult due to the heat?","id":"5a4c4cfc7a6c4c001a2bbbdc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the Great Desert","answer_start":800}],"question":"What is the second largest continuious area in the world?","id":"5a4c4cfc7a6c4c001a2bbbdd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"average high temperature","answer_start":1711}],"question":"What reaches 80 degrees F during the day?","id":"5a4c4cfc7a6c4c001a2bbbde","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"2,800 kWh\/(m2 year)","answer_start":579}],"question":"How much solar energy does the Sahara produce per year?","id":"5a60df46e9e1cc001a33cdc0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"47 \u00b0C (116.6 \u00b0F)","answer_start":1165}],"question":"What is the lowest temperature recorded in the Sahara?","id":"5a60df46e9e1cc001a33cdc1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"378 meters above sea level","answer_start":1269}],"question":"What is the elevation of the Nubian Desert?","id":"5a60df46e9e1cc001a33cdc2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"46 \u00b0C (114.8 \u00b0F)","answer_start":1597}],"question":"What is the average low temperature in Salah?","id":"5a60df46e9e1cc001a33cdc3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"13 \u00b0C (55.4 \u00b0F)","answer_start":3292}],"question":"What is the temperature of the sand during the night?","id":"5a60df46e9e1cc001a33cdc4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The sky is usually clear above the desert and the sunshine duration is extremely high everywhere in the Sahara. Most of the desert enjoys more than 3,600 h of bright sunshine annually or over 82% of the time and a wide area in the eastern part experiences in excess of 4,000 h of bright sunshine a year or over 91% of the time, and the highest values are very close to the theoretical maximum value. A value of 4,300 h or 98% of the time would be recorded in Upper Egypt (Aswan, Luxor) and in the Nubian Desert (Wadi Halfa). The annual average direct solar irradiation is around 2,800 kWh\/(m2 year) in the Great Desert. The Sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production. The constantly high position of the sun, the extremely low relative humidity, the lack of vegetation and rainfall make the Great Desert the hottest continuously large area worldwide and certainly the hottest place on Earth during summertime in some spots. The average high temperature exceeds 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F) - 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) during the hottest month nearly everywhere in the desert except at very high mountainous areas. The highest officially recorded average high temperature was 47 \u00b0C (116.6 \u00b0F) in a remote desert town in the Algerian Desert called Bou Bernous with an elevation of 378 meters above sea level. It's the world's highest recorded average high temperature and only Death Valley, California rivals it. Other hot spots in Algeria such as Adrar, Timimoun, In Salah, Ouallene, Aoulef, Reggane with an elevation between 200 and 400 meters above sea level get slightly lower summer average highs around 46 \u00b0C (114.8 \u00b0F) during the hottest months of the year. Salah, well known in Algeria for its extreme heat, has an average high temperature of 43.8 \u00b0C (110.8 \u00b0F), 46.4 \u00b0C (115.5 \u00b0F), 45.5 (113.9 \u00b0F). Furthermore, 41.9 \u00b0C (107.4 \u00b0F) in June, July, August and September. In fact, there are even hotter spots in the Sahara, but they are located in extremely remote areas, especially in the Azalai, lying in northern Mali. The major part of the desert experiences around 3 \u2013 5 months when the average high strictly exceeds 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). The southern central part of the desert experiences up to 6 \u2013 7 months when the average high temperature strictly exceeds 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) which shows the constancy and the length of the really hot season in the Sahara. Some examples of this are Bilma, Niger and Faya-Largeau, Chad. The annual average daily temperature exceeds 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) everywhere and can approach 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in the hottest regions year-round. However, most of the desert has a value in excess of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). The sand and ground temperatures are even more extreme. During daytime, the sand temperature is extremely high as it can easily reach 80 \u00b0C (176 \u00b0F) or more. A sand temperature of 83.5 \u00b0C (182.3 \u00b0F) has been recorded in Port Sudan. Ground temperatures of 72 \u00b0C (161.6 \u00b0F) have been recorded in the Adrar of Mauritania and a value of 75 \u00b0C (167 \u00b0F) has been measured in Borkou, northern Chad. Due to lack of cloud cover and very low humidity, the desert usually features high diurnal temperature variations between days and nights. However, it's a myth that the nights are cold after extremely hot days in the Sahara. The average diurnal temperature range is typically between 13 \u00b0C (55.4 \u00b0F) and 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F). The lowest values are found along the coastal regions due to high humidity and are often even lower than 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F), while the highest values are found in inland desert areas where the humidity is the lowest, mainly in the southern Sahara. Still, it's true that winter nights can be cold as it can drop to the freezing point and even below, especially in high-elevation areas."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the reason the northern fringe receives more   cloudiness and rainfall?","id":"5728c4ee3acd2414000dfdfb","answers":[{"text":"low pressure systems","answer_start":268}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the average rainfall of the Sahara?","id":"5728c4ee3acd2414000dfdfc","answers":[{"text":"less than 1 mm","answer_start":1156}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much desert land is the Sahara?","id":"5728c4ee3acd2414000dfdfd","answers":[{"text":"9,000,000 km2 of desert land","answer_start":1253}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What causes the southern fringe to receive cloudiness and   rainfall?","id":"5728c4ee3acd2414000dfdfe","answers":[{"text":"Intertropical Convergence Zone","answer_start":699}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"annual rainfall","answer_start":12}],"question":"what is nearly non existent across the Sahara?","id":"5a4c50d07a6c4c001a2bbbe4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"low pressure systems over the Mediterranean Sea along the polar front","answer_start":268}],"question":"What contributes to the north's cloudiness and moderate rainfall??","id":"5a4c50d07a6c4c001a2bbbe5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"southern fringe of the desert","answer_start":571}],"question":"What area is cloudy and dry in the summer?","id":"5a4c50d07a6c4c001a2bbbe6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the Sahara","answer_start":1199}],"question":"What has a land area of 9,000,000 sq mi?","id":"5a4c50d07a6c4c001a2bbbe7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The thin northern fringe","answer_start":162}],"question":"What area receives the least amount of winter cloudiness?","id":"5a610113e9e1cc001a33ce2e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The vast central hyper-arid core","answer_start":897}],"question":"What is drastically affected by northerly or southerly atmospheric disturbances?","id":"5a610113e9e1cc001a33ce2f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"31%","answer_start":1335}],"question":"What percentage of Niger receives and annual rainfall above 10mm?","id":"5a610113e9e1cc001a33ce30","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"17%","answer_start":1461}],"question":"What percentage of Dakhla has an annual rainfall of 5mm or less?","id":"5a610113e9e1cc001a33ce31","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"nearly non-existent","answer_start":103}],"question":"What is rainfall like in the western fringes of the desert?","id":"5a610113e9e1cc001a33ce32","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The average annual rainfall ranges from very low in the northern and southern fringes of the desert to nearly non-existent over the central and the eastern part. The thin northern fringe of the desert receives more winter cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of low pressure systems over the Mediterranean Sea along the polar front, although very attenuated by the rain shadow effects of the mountains and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 mm (3,93 in) to 250 mm (9,84 in). For example, Biskra, Algeria and Ouarzazate, Morocco are found in this zone. The southern fringe of the desert along the border with the Sahel receives summer cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of the Intertropical Convergence Zone from the south and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 mm (3,93 in) to 250 mm (9,84 in). For example, Timbuktu, Mali and Agadez, Niger are found in this zone. The vast central hyper-arid core of the desert is virtually never affected by northerly or southerly atmospheric disturbances and permanently remains under the influence of the strongest anticyclonic weather regime and the annual average rainfall can drop to less than 1 mm (0.04 in). In fact, most of the Sahara receives less than 20 mm (0.79 in). Of the 9,000,000 km2 of desert land in the Sahara, an area of about 2,800,000 km2 (about 31% of the total area) receives an annual average rainfall amount of 10 mm (0.39 in) or less, while some 1,500,000 km2 (about 17% of the total area) receive an average of 5 mm or less. The annual average rainfall is virtually zero over a wide area of some 1,000,000 km2 in the eastern Sahara comprising deserts of Libya, Egypt and Sudan (Tazirbu, Kufra, Dakhla, Kharga, Farafra, Siwa, Asyut, Sohag, Luxor, Aswan, Abu Simbel, Wadi Halfa) where the long-term mean approximates 0.5 mm per year. The rainfall is very unreliable and erratic in the Sahara as it may vary considerably year by year.

Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in 1976. Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it.[citation needed] The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the end of the NFL season (since 2011 is played the week prior to the Super Bowl), is also considered an exhibition game."}]},"281":{"title":"Northwestern_University","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What is the name of Northwestern's main student newspaper?","id":"572804a92ca10214002d9ba8","answers":[{"text":"The Daily Northwestern","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who is The Daily Northwestern entirely directed by?","id":"572804a92ca10214002d9ba9","answers":[{"text":"undergraduates","answer_start":154}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who owns The Daily Northwestern?","id":"572804a92ca10214002d9baa","answers":[{"text":"the Students Publishing Company","answer_start":321}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of Northwestern's undergraduate yearbook?","id":"572804a92ca10214002d9bab","answers":[{"text":"Syllabus","answer_start":694}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What undergraduate satirical magazine was founded in 2009?","id":"572804a92ca10214002d9bac","answers":[{"text":"Northwestern Flipside","answer_start":934}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Daily Northwestern","answer_start":0}],"question":" What is the name of Southwestern's main student newspaper?","id":"5ad2ceb6d7d075001a42a2ea","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"undergraduates","answer_start":154}],"question":" Who is The Daily Southwestern entirely directed by?","id":"5ad2ceb6d7d075001a42a2eb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Students Publishing Company","answer_start":325}],"question":" Who owns The Daily Southwestern?","id":"5ad2ceb6d7d075001a42a2ec","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Syllabus","answer_start":694}],"question":" What is the name of Southwestern's undergraduate yearbook?","id":"5ad2ceb6d7d075001a42a2ed","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Northwestern Flipside","answer_start":934}],"question":" What undergraduate satirical magazine was founded in 2007?","id":"5ad2ceb6d7d075001a42a2ee","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The Daily Northwestern is the main student newspaper.

The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German parliament demanding the return of those territories to France. At the last Reichstag election in Strasbourg and its periphery, the clear winners were the Social Democrats; the city was the administrative capital of the region, was inhabited by many Germans appointed by the central government in Berlin and its flourishing economy attracted many Germans. This could explain the difference between the rural vote and the one in Strasbourg.

Many subatomic particles exist for only a fixed fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but some that travel close to the speed of light can be measured to travel farther and survive much longer than expected (a muon is one example). According to the special theory of relativity, in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to \"slow down\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten.

This is generally a consequence of time being modeled by a parameter in the system being analyzed, where there is no \"proper time\": the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the Second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy must increase over time (see Entropy); the cosmological arrow of time, which points away from the Big Bang, CPT symmetry, and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only traveling forwards in time (see light cone). In particle physics, the violation of CP symmetry implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve CPT symmetry as stated above. The standard description of measurement in quantum mechanics is also time asymmetric (see Measurement in quantum mechanics)."},{"qas":[{"question":"Stephen Hawking makes a connection between time and what?","id":"57280f51ff5b5019007d9c12","answers":[{"text":"the Big Bang","answer_start":74}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which publication does Hawking say that any events that existed before the Big Bang would not be accessible to us?","id":"57280f51ff5b5019007d9c13","answers":[{"text":"A Brief History of Time","answer_start":91}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does Hawking suggest started with the big bang?","id":"57280f51ff5b5019007d9c14","answers":[{"text":"time","answer_start":428}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Hawking also states that questions about what happened before the Big Bang are what?","id":"57280f51ff5b5019007d9c15","answers":[{"text":"meaningless","answer_start":530}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which philosopher has criticized Hawking's formulation?","id":"57280f51ff5b5019007d9c16","answers":[{"text":"Aristotelian philosopher Mortimer J.

Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round. On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average. This winter precipitation maximum is quite unusual for humid continental climates, which most commonly have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the Midwestern U.S.). Most heavy precipitation events in St. John's are the product of intense mid-latitude storms migrating from the Northeastern U.S. and New England states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly 4 to 8 centimetres of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds. In winter, two or more types of precipitation (rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow) can fall from passage of a single storm. Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 335 centimetres per winter season. However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types. Heavy snow can transition to heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation. Snow cover in St. John's is variable, and especially early in the winter season, may be slow to develop, but can extend deeply into the spring months (March, April).

This latter property can be illustrated by a simple example. Suppose we are dealing with particles (such as electrons) of semi-integral spin (angular momentum) for which there are only two possible values: positive or negative. Then, a principle of indetermination establishes that the spin, relative to two different directions (e.g., x and y) results in a pair of incompatible quantities. Suppose that the state \u0278 of a certain electron verifies the proposition \"the spin of the electron in the x direction is positive.\" By the principle of indeterminacy, the value of the spin in the direction y will be completely indeterminate for \u0278. Hence, \u0278 can verify neither the proposition \"the spin in the direction of y is positive\" nor the proposition \"the spin in the direction of y is negative.\" Nevertheless, the disjunction of the propositions \"the spin in the direction of y is positive or the spin in the direction of y is negative\" must be true for \u0278.

Unfortunately, quite a few, such as Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their CAV or CLV Disco Vision originals. The time-compressed CLV re-issue of Jaws no longer had the original soundtrack, having had incidental background music replaced for the video disc version due to licensing cost (the music would not be available until the THX LaserDisc box set was released in 1995). One Universal\/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs.

New research, however, argues that this cannot be correct, as dividing sovereignty - when this concept is properly understood in its core meaning of the final and absolute source of political authority in a political community - is not possible. The descent of the United States into Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century, over disputes about unallocated competences concerning slavery and ultimately the right of secession, showed this. One or other level of government could be sovereign to decide such matters, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, it is now suggested that federalism is more appropriately conceived as 'a division of the powers flowing from sovereignty between two levels of government'. What differentiates the concept from other multi-level political forms is the characteristic of equality of standing between the two levels of government established. This clarified definition opens the way to identifying two distinct federal forms, where before only one was known, based upon whether sovereignty resides in the whole (in one people) or in the parts (in many peoples): the federal state (or federation) and the federal union of states (or federal union), respectively. Leading examples of the federal state include the United States, Germany, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and India.

Beyond this the precise division of power varies from one nation to another. The constitutions of Germany and the United States provide that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the states. The Constitution of some countries like Canada and India, on the other hand, state that powers not explicitly granted to the provincial governments are retained by the federal government. Much like the US system, the Australian Constitution allocates to the Federal government (the Commonwealth of Australia) the power to make laws about certain specified matters which were considered too difficult for the States to manage, so that the States retain all other areas of responsibility.

Two families, the Eunicidae and Phyllodocidae, have evolved jaws, which can be used for seizing prey, biting off pieces of vegetation, or grasping dead and decaying matter. On the other hand, some predatory polychaetes have neither jaws nor eversible pharynges. Selective deposit feeders generally live in tubes on the sea-floor and use palps to find food particles in the sediment and then wipe them into their mouths. Filter feeders use \"crowns\" of palps covered in cilia that wash food particles towards their mouths. Non-selective deposit feeders ingest soil or marine sediments via mouths that are generally unspecialized. Some clitellates have sticky pads in the roofs of their mouths, and some of these can evert the pads to capture prey.

These species use a variety of methods for sperm transfer; for example, in some the females collect sperm released into the water, while in others the males have a penis that inject sperm into the female. There is no guarantee that this is a representative sample of polychaetes' reproductive patterns, and it simply reflects scientists' current knowledge."},{"qas":[{"question":"When did Cloudina exist?","id":"572832dc4b864d19001646f0","answers":[{"text":"549 to 542 million years ago","answer_start":383}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What do some people think Cloudina should be called instead of an annelid?","id":"572832dc4b864d19001646f1","answers":[{"text":"cnidarian","answer_start":483}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How old were the fossils of Canadia and Burgessochaeta found in Canada?","id":"572832dc4b864d19001646f2","answers":[{"text":"505 million years","answer_start":714}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What era was underway 505 million years ago?","id":"572832dc4b864d19001646f3","answers":[{"text":"early Cambrian","answer_start":743}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where was Myoscolex found?","id":"572832dc4b864d19001646f4","answers":[{"text":"Australia","answer_start":779}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"549 to 542 million years ago","answer_start":383}],"question":"When did Cloudina disappear?","id":"5ace8c1532bba1001ae4a9fd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"cnidarian","answer_start":483}],"question":"What do all people think Cloudina should be called instead of an annelid?","id":"5ace8c1532bba1001ae4a9fe","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"505 million years","answer_start":714}],"question":"How old were the fossils of Canadia and Burgessochaeta found in Australia?","id":"5ace8c1532bba1001ae4a9ff","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Australia","answer_start":779}],"question":"Where was Myoscolex unknown?","id":"5ace8c1532bba1001ae4aa00","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Since annelids are soft-bodied, their fossils are rare. Polychaetes' fossil record consists mainly of the jaws that some species had and the mineralized tubes that some secreted. Some Ediacaran fossils such as Dickinsonia in some ways resemble polychaetes, but the similarities are too vague for these fossils to be classified with confidence. The small shelly fossil Cloudina, from 549 to 542 million years ago, has been classified by some authors as an annelid, but by others as a cnidarian (i.e. in the phylum to which jellyfish and sea anemones belong). Until 2008 the earliest fossils widely accepted as annelids were the polychaetes Canadia and Burgessochaeta, both from Canada's Burgess Shale, formed about 505 million years ago in the early Cambrian. Myoscolex, found in Australia and a little older than the Burgess Shale, was possibly an annelid. However, it lacks some typical annelid features and has features which are not usually found in annelids and some of which are associated with other phyla. Then Simon Conway Morris and John Peel reported Phragmochaeta from Sirius Passet, about 518 million years old, and concluded that it was the oldest annelid known to date. There has been vigorous debate about whether the Burgess Shale fossil Wiwaxia was a mollusc or an annelid. Polychaetes diversified in the early Ordovician, about 488 to 474 million years ago. It is not until the early Ordovician that the first annelid jaws are found, thus the crown-group cannot have appeared before this date and probably appeared somewhat later. By the end of the Carboniferous, about 299 million years ago, fossils of most of the modern mobile polychaete groups had appeared. Many fossil tubes look like those made by modern sessile polychaetes  , but the first tubes clearly produced by polychaetes date from the Jurassic, less than 199 million years ago."},{"qas":[{"question":"What superphylum are annelids in?","id":"57283593ff5b5019007d9f24","answers":[{"text":"protostomes","answer_start":28}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the other superphylum besides protostomes?","id":"57283593ff5b5019007d9f25","answers":[{"text":"deuterostomes","answer_start":114}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What superphylum are vertebrates in?","id":"57283593ff5b5019007d9f26","answers":[{"text":"deuterostomes","answer_start":114}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does 'Articulata' mean?","id":"57283593ff5b5019007d9f27","answers":[{"text":"jointed animals","answer_start":260}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are lophophores?","id":"57283593ff5b5019007d9f28","answers":[{"text":"fan-like feeding structures","answer_start":847}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"protostomes","answer_start":28}],"question":"What superphylum are annelids now excluded from?","id":"5ace8e3432bba1001ae4aa35","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"deuterostomes","answer_start":114}],"question":"What is one of many superphylums besides protostomes?","id":"5ace8e3432bba1001ae4aa36","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"deuterostomes","answer_start":114}],"question":"What superpower are vertebrates in?","id":"5ace8e3432bba1001ae4aa37","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"fan-like feeding structures","answer_start":847}],"question":"What are lophosmores?","id":"5ace8e3432bba1001ae4aa38","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Annelids are members of the protostomes, one of the two major superphyla of bilaterian animals \u2013 the other is the deuterostomes, which includes vertebrates.

However, the genes that drive segmentation in arthropods do not appear to do the same in annelids. Arthropods and annelids both have close relatives that are unsegmented. It is at least as easy to assume that they evolved segmented bodies independently as it is to assume that the ancestral protostome or bilaterian was segmented and that segmentation disappeared in many descendant phyla. The current view is that annelids are grouped with molluscs, brachiopods and several other phyla that have lophophores (fan-like feeding structures) and\/or trochophore larvae as members of Lophotrochozoa. Bryzoa may be the most basal phylum (the one that first became distinctive) within the Lophotrochozoa, and the relationships between the other members are not yet known.

One view is taken by exclusivists, who believe they are the chosen people or have exclusive access to absolute truth, generally through revelation or encounter with the Divine, which adherents of other religions do not. Another view is religious pluralism. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but does not deny the partial truth of other religions. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is supersessionism, i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is relativistic inclusivism, where everybody is seen as equally right; an example being universalism: the doctrine that salvation is eventually available for everyone.

All of Karl Popper's grandparents were Jewish, but the Popper family converted to Lutheranism before Karl was born, and so he received Lutheran baptism. They understood this as part of their cultural assimilation, not as an expression of devout belief. Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a lawyer from Bohemia and a doctor of law at the Vienna University, and mother Jenny Schiff was of Silesian and Hungarian descent. After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund Carl became a partner in the law firm of Vienna's liberal Burgomaster Herr Gr\u00fcbl and, after Gr\u00fcbl's death in 1898, Simon took over the business. (Malachi Hacohen records that Herr Gr\u00fcbl's first name was Raimund, after which Karl received his middle name. Popper himself, in his autobiography, erroneously recalls that Herr Gr\u00fcbl's first name was Carl.) His father was a bibliophile who had 12,000\u201314,000 volumes in his personal library.

Rather, it means that, if \"T\" is false, then (in principle), \"T\" could be shown to be false, by observation or by experiment. Popper's account of the logical asymmetry between verification and falsifiability lies at the heart of his philosophy of science. It also inspired him to take falsifiability as his criterion of demarcation between what is, and is not, genuinely scientific: a theory should be considered scientific if, and only if, it is falsifiable.

Thus we can only say that the whole package of relevant theories has been collectively falsified, but cannot conclusively say which element of the package must be replaced. An example of this is given by the discovery of the planet Neptune: when the motion of Uranus was found not to match the predictions of Newton's laws, the theory \"There are seven planets in the solar system\" was rejected, and not Newton's laws themselves. Popper discussed this critique of na\u00efve falsificationism in Chapters 3 and 4 of The Logic of Scientific Discovery. For Popper, theories are accepted or rejected via a sort of selection process. Theories that say more about the way things appear are to be preferred over those that do not; the more generally applicable a theory is, the greater its value. Thus Newton's laws, with their wide general application, are to be preferred over the much more specific \"the solar system has seven planets\".[dubious \u2013 discuss]"},{"qas":[{"question":"What kind of criteria frequently used in science complicates the definitiveness of some hypotheses' falsification?","id":"5728e14d2ca10214002daa18","answers":[{"text":"statistical","answer_start":118}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What other flaws complicate the problem of identifying faulty scientific hypotheses?","id":"5728e14d2ca10214002daa19","answers":[{"text":"flaws in the evidence","answer_start":309}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"According to Popper, what resolves conflicting hypotheses and observations in the long run?","id":"5728e14d2ca10214002daa1a","answers":[{"text":"the collective judgment of scientists","answer_start":700}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"demonstrate falsehood definitively","answer_start":55}],"question":"What is always possible to do?","id":"5ad278d3d7d075001a429584","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"this is a sign of flaws in the hypothesis","answer_start":252}],"question":"What is always clear if evidence contradicts a hypothesis?","id":"5ad278d3d7d075001a429585","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Popper","answer_start":529}],"question":"Who wrote a set of instructions that merely need to be followed diligently to achieve science?","id":"5ad278d3d7d075001a429586","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"resolution of conflicts between hypotheses and observations","answer_start":616}],"question":"What is a matter of the judgement of a single scientist?","id":"5ad278d3d7d075001a429587","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"evidence contradicts a hypothesis","answer_start":212}],"question":"What is a sign of flaws in the evidence?","id":"5ad278d3d7d075001a429588","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Another objection is that it is not always possible to demonstrate falsehood definitively, especially if one is using statistical criteria to evaluate a null hypothesis.

These examples were pointed out by Carl Gustav Hempel. Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category.

Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums, instructional books and DVDs, as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents. The instrument has also found its way into British rock music. The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield (and introduced by Vivian Stanshall) on Oldfield's album Tubular Bells, as well as on a number of his subsequent albums (particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge (1974) and Ommadawn (1975)). It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne, who featured two members on the instrument, Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe, and whose \"Fog on the Tyne\" was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972. The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs. Maggie May by Rod Stewart, which hit No. 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100, also featured Jackson's playing. It has also been used by other British rock musicians. Led Zeppelin's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That's the Way; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page, who composed the song. Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do, and Black Country Woman. Pete Townshend of The Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme, along with many other tracks on Endless Wire. McGuinness Flint, for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single, When I'm Dead And Gone, is another example. Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance, and played mandolin on their hit How Come. One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in The Incredible String Band. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player (beautiful track Pussy Willow), as is his guitarist Martin Barre. The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr. More recently, the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin, played by Ailidh Lennon, on tracks such as Fight, Start to End, and Medicine. British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs. Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs. The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse. It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney's 2007 hit \"Dance Tonight.\" That was not the first time a Beatle played a mandolin, however; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo, the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name. The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people. Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin. This song was left off their debut album, and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"What type of mandolin do rock musicians today use?

The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song \"Locust Street.\" Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize\/Hypnotize. Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley, violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band's music.

Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube.

This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach Blaptica dubia, as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous. The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, such as those in the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera, are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive.:129, 131, 134\u2013135 Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos.:136\u2013137 Insects may be univoltine, bivoltine or multivoltine, i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year."},{"qas":[{"question":"Incomplete metamorphosis insects are called?","id":"57295e7c6aef051400154d8c","answers":[{"text":"Hemimetabolous","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kind of metamorphosis do hemimetabolous insects undergo?","id":"57295e7c6aef051400154d8d","answers":[{"text":"incomplete","answer_start":35}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Do hemimetabolous insects change quickly or gradually?","id":"57295e7c6aef051400154d8e","answers":[{"text":"gradually","answer_start":68}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Hemimetabolous insects gradually change by a series of what?","id":"57295e7c6aef051400154d8f","answers":[{"text":"molts","answer_start":104}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Insect's molt when they outgrow what?","id":"57295e7c6aef051400154d90","answers":[{"text":"exoskeleton","answer_start":148}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Hemimetabolous insects, those with incomplete metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing a series of molts.

These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions.

Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2 kHz., and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50 kHz.

The African cicada Brevisana brevis has been measured at 106.7 decibels at a distance of 50 cm (20 in). Some insects, such as the Helicoverpa zeamoths, hawk moths and Hedylid butterflies, can hear ultrasound and take evasive action when they sense that they have been detected by bats. Some moths produce ultrasonic clicks that were once thought to have a role in jamming bat echolocation. The ultrasonic clicks were subsequently found to be produced mostly by unpalatable moths to warn bats, just as warning colorations are used against predators that hunt by sight. Some otherwise palatable moths have evolved to mimic these calls. More recently, the claim that some moths can jam bat sonar has been revisited.

This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families, especially those that feed on wood or vegetation, such as many of the leaf beetles (family Chrysomelidae) or weevils. In some of these species, sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate. Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as O. macklotti and Palophus centaurus) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift (B. scabrinota, T. californica). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis, a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death (catalepsy), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period.

Some insects, like wasps, bees, butterflies and ants, pollinate flowering plants. Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects. As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species, they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed. This greatly increases plants' ability to cross-pollinate, which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness. This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture. As well as pollination ants help with seed distribution of plants. This helps to spread the plants which increases plant diversity. This leads to an overall better environment. A serious environmental problem is the decline of populations of pollinator insects, and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field, orchard or greenhouse at bloom time.:240\u2013243 Another solution, as shown in Delaware, has been to raise native plants to help support native pollinators like L. vierecki.

They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental population. Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from New Guinea.

The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers).

Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \"bistro\" means \"quickly\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.

Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"coalition of the willing\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no \"smoking guns\". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W.

First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted \"democratization\" of Iraq lost some support as months passed and casualty figures increased, with no decrease in violence nor progress toward stability or reconstruction.

It was clear that the result in Ohio, along with two other states who had still not declared (New Mexico and Iowa), would decide the winner. Bush had established a lead of around 130,000 votes but the Democrats pointed to provisional ballots that had yet to be counted, initially reported to number as high as 200,000. Bush had preliminary leads of less than 5% of the vote in only four states, but if Iowa, Nevada and New Mexico had all eventually gone to Kerry, a win for Bush in Ohio would have created a 269\u2013269 tie in the Electoral College. The result of an electoral tie would cause the election to be decided in the House of Representatives with each state casting one vote, regardless of population. Such a scenario would almost certainly have resulted in a victory for Bush, as Republicans controlled more House delegations. Therefore, the outcome of the election hinged solely on the result in Ohio, regardless of the final totals elsewhere. In the afternoon Ohio's Secretary of State, Ken Blackwell, announced that it was statistically impossible for the Democrats to make up enough valid votes in the provisional ballots to win. At the time provisional ballots were reported as numbering 140,000 (and later estimated to be only 135,000). Faced with this announcement, John Kerry conceded defeat. Had Kerry won Ohio, he would have won the election despite losing the national popular vote by over 3 million votes, a complete reversal of the 2000 election when Bush won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Al Gore by over 500,000 votes."},{"qas":[{"question":"What did Kerry say affected the ability to know if the results of the Ohio vote was unbiased?","id":"57296704af94a219006aa39b","answers":[{"text":"\"the widespread irregularities make it impossible to know for certain that the [Ohio] outcome reflected the will of the voters.\"","answer_start":29}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which Democratic official supported Kerry's theory about the Ohio votes?","id":"57296704af94a219006aa39c","answers":[{"text":"Howard Dean","answer_start":218}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was said about the devices used to collect the votes, in Ohio?","id":"57296704af94a219006aa39d","answers":[{"text":"the machines were not reliable","answer_start":360}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was targeted for defrauding the electoral process, in Ohio?","id":"57296704af94a219006aa39e","answers":[{"text":"the Republicans are willing to do things that are unethical to manipulate elections","answer_start":425}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"not reliable","answer_start":378}],"question":"What did Kerry think the state of voter machines was?","id":"5a725fcc53a187001ae630f5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Republicans","answer_start":429}],"question":"Who did Kerry think was unethical in the election?","id":"5a725fcc53a187001ae630f6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"that the [Ohio] outcome reflected the will of the voters","answer_start":99}],"question":"What did the DNC say wasn't possible to know for certain?","id":"5a725fcc53a187001ae630f7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"voter","answer_start":337}],"question":"What kind of suppression was there in Ohio according to Kerry?","id":"5a725fcc53a187001ae630f8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"things that are unethical","answer_start":459}],"question":"What did the DNC say Kerry was guilty of in the election?","id":"5a725fcc53a187001ae630f9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Kerry would later state that \"the widespread irregularities make it impossible to know for certain that the [Ohio] outcome reflected the will of the voters.\" In the same article, Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said \"I'm not confident that the election in Ohio was fairly decided...

Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be colored by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or molded into any shape, and also because it is a sterile product, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and reading glasses."}]},"317":{"title":"Planck_constant","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Before Planck, it was assumed that the energy of a body could take on what value?","id":"572928341d046914007790e1","answers":[{"text":"any","answer_start":84}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The Rayleigh-Jeans law makes close predictions for what amount of values?","id":"572928341d046914007790e2","answers":[{"text":"a narrow range","answer_start":193}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does Planck's law correctly predict?","id":"572928341d046914007790e3","answers":[{"text":"blackbody emissions","answer_start":368}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In making Planck's law, what was in both the numerator and denominator of the formula that was used?","id":"572928341d046914007790e4","answers":[{"text":"h","answer_start":477}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Planck's work disproved what assumption?","id":"572962c51d04691400779375","answers":[{"text":"that the energy of a body could take on any value whatsoever","answer_start":44}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What rule predicted narrow range of energy values at lower temperatures?","id":"572962c51d04691400779376","answers":[{"text":"The Rayleigh\u2013Jeans","answer_start":142}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Planck's law involved what necessary mathematical step to correctly predict blackbody emission?","id":"572962c51d04691400779377","answers":[{"text":"multiply the classical expression by a complex factor that involves h in both the numerator and the denominator","answer_start":409}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Changing values of n, the Boltzmann constant, or other variables resulted in learning what about Planck's law?","id":"572962c51d04691400779378","answers":[{"text":"Making an equation out of Planck's law that would reproduce the Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law could not be done","answer_start":630}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The disparity between Planck's law and the Rayleigh-Jeans law led to what conclusion?","id":"572962c51d04691400779379","answers":[{"text":"the picture given by classical physics is not duplicated by a range of results in the quantum picture","answer_start":854}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"any value","answer_start":84}],"question":"What was assumed that the energy of a body could never take on before Planck?","id":"5a3ab49c3ff257001ab84207","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a narrow range","answer_start":193}],"question":"What does the Rayleigh-Jeans law avoid predictions for in terms of values?","id":"5a3ab49c3ff257001ab84208","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"blackbody emissions","answer_start":368}],"question":"What does Planck's law incorrectly predict?","id":"5a3ab49c3ff257001ab84209","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"h","answer_start":539}],"question":"What in making Planck's law was in neither the numerator and denominator of the formula that was used?","id":"5a3ab49c3ff257001ab8420a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"that the energy of a body could take on any value whatsoever","answer_start":44}],"question":"What assumption was confirmed based on Planck's work?","id":"5a3ab49c3ff257001ab8420b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Prior to Planck's work, it had been assumed that the energy of a body could take on any value whatsoever \u2013 that it was a continuous variable.

In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, when the color of clothing showed the owner's social status, green was worn by merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was the color of the nobility. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci wears green, showing she is not from a noble family; the benches in the British House of Commons are green, while those in the House of Lords are red. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a green card permits permanent residence in the United States. It is the most important color in Islam. It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries, and represents the lush vegetation of Paradise. It is also often associated with the culture of Gaelic Ireland, and is a color of the flag of Ireland. Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the environmental movement.

And within Serbo-Croatian, the Serbian variant, with twice as many speakers as the Croatian, enjoyed greater prestige, reinforced by the fact that Slovene and Macedonian speakers preferred it to the Croatian variant because their languages are also Ekavian. This is a common situation in other pluricentric languages, e.g. the variants of German differ according to their prestige, the variants of Portuguese too.

The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet\u2014 which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babi\u0107 further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication\u2019s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis."}]},"324":{"title":"CBC_Television","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What was Canada's date for the switch between analog and digital transmission?","id":"572a419a1d046914007798a3","answers":[{"text":"August 31, 2011","answer_start":379}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did CBC announce on August 31, 2011?","id":"572a419a1d046914007798a4","answers":[{"text":"it will not extend its association with any of its private affiliates","answer_start":302}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In March 2011, CBC and CKPR agreed to continue working together for how many additional years?","id":"572a419a1d046914007798a5","answers":[{"text":"five","answer_start":968}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who purchased CFTK and CJDC in March 2012?","id":"572a419a1d046914007798a6","answers":[{"text":"Bell Media","answer_start":1048}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"will not extend its association with any of its private affiliates","answer_start":305}],"question":"The CBC cited not wanting to pay for the transition from analog to digital as it's reason for doing this?","id":"5a552284134fea001a0e196c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"August 31, 2011","answer_start":379}],"question":"The CBC's refusal meant that hundreds of thousands would not have television access after what date?","id":"5a552284134fea001a0e196d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"CKPR","answer_start":802}],"question":"The CRTC requested that the CBC negotiate with this station in order to extend their contract?","id":"5a552284134fea001a0e196e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"$3.38 billion","answer_start":1091}],"question":"CTV and CTV2 purchased Bell Media in 2012 for what sum?","id":"5a552284134fea001a0e196f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"According to filings to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) by Thunder Bay Electronics (owner of CBC's Thunder Bay affiliate CKPR-DT) and Bell Media (owner of CBC affiliates CFTK-TV in Terrace and CJDC-TV in Dawson Creek),[citation needed] the CBC informed them that it will not extend its association with any of its private affiliates beyond August 31, 2011.

Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism. Energy is thus often said to be stored by cells in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids, and proteins, which release energy when reacted with oxygen in respiration. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500 kJ per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 \u00f7 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts.

This energy is triggered and released in nuclear fission bombs or in civil nuclear power generation. Similarly, in the case of a chemical explosion, chemical potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy and thermal energy in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a pendulum. At its highest points the kinetic energy is zero and the gravitational potential energy is at maximum.

The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling.

In central and eastern Islamic lands, the view that the madrasa, as a charitable endowment, will remain under the control of the donor (and their descendent), resulted in a \"spurt\" of establishment of madaris in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, in Western Islamic lands, where the Maliki views prohibited donors from controlling their endowment, madaris were not as popular. Unlike the corporate designation of Western institutions of higher learning, the waqf designation seemed to have led to the exclusion of non-orthodox religious subjects such a philosophy and natural science from the curricula. The madrasa of al-Qaraw\u012by\u012bn, one of the two surviving madaris that predate the founding of the earliest medieval universities and are thus claimed to be the \"first universities\" by some authors, has acquired official university status as late as 1947. The other, al-Azhar, did acquire this status in name and essence only in the course of numerous reforms during the 19th and 20th century, notably the one of 1961 which introduced non-religious subjects to its curriculum, such as economics, engineering, medicine, and agriculture. It should also be noted that many medieval universities were run for centuries as Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools prior to their formal establishment as universitas scholarium; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the university dates back to the 6th century AD, thus well preceding the earliest madaris.

This reveals that the Islamic world was interconnected in the early modern period as they travelled around to other Islamic states exchanging knowledge. This sense that the Ottoman Empire was becoming modernised through globalization is also recognised by Hamadeh who says: \"Change in the eighteenth century as the beginning of a long and unilinear march toward westernisation reflects the two centuries of reformation in sovereign identity.\" \u0130nalc\u0131k also mentions that while scholars from for example Persia travelled to the Ottomans in order to share their knowledge, Ottomans travelled as well to receive education from scholars of these Islamic lands, such as Egypt, Persia and Turkestan. Hence, this reveals that similar to today's modern world, individuals from the early modern society travelled abroad to receive education and share knowledge and that the world was more interconnected than it seems. Also, it reveals how the system of \"schooling\" was also similar to today's modern world where students travel abroad to different countries for studies. Examples of Ottoman madaris are the ones built by Mehmed the Conqueror. He built eight madaris that were built \"on either side of the mosque where there were eight higher madaris for specialised studies and eight lower medreses, which prepared students for these.\" The fact that they were built around, or near mosques reveals the religious impulses behind madrasa building and it reveals the interconnectedness between institutions of learning and religion. The students who completed their education in the lower medreses became known as danismends. This reveals that similar to the education system today, the Ottomans' educational system involved different kinds of schools attached to different kinds of levels. For example, there were lower madaris and specialised ones, and for one to get into the specialised area meant that he had to complete the classes in the lower one in order to adequately prepare himself for higher learning."},{"qas":[{"question":"What was the essential mission of Islamic schools in the Ottoman Empire?","id":"572a85df111d821400f38bac","answers":[{"text":"spiritual learning","answer_start":203}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Why was philosophy taught in Ottoman madaris?","id":"572a85df111d821400f38bad","answers":[{"text":"confirm the doctrines of Islam","answer_start":1010}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of social structure did the Ottoman Empire have?","id":"572a85df111d821400f38bae","answers":[{"text":"pluralistic","answer_start":1260}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What religion was at the center of education in the Ottoman Empire?","id":"572a85df111d821400f38baf","answers":[{"text":"Islam","answer_start":1431}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did Ottoman madaris have that was similar to modern American schools?","id":"572a85df111d821400f38bb0","answers":[{"text":"wide range of studies","answer_start":1976}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"spiritual learning","answer_start":203}],"question":"What was the essential mission of non-Islamic schools in the Ottoman Empire?","id":"5ace818332bba1001ae4a8a9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"confirm the doctrines of Islam","answer_start":1010}],"question":" Why wasn't philosophy taught in Ottoman madaris?","id":"5ace818332bba1001ae4a8aa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"pluralistic","answer_start":1260}],"question":" What type of social structure did the Ottoman Empire not have?","id":"5ace818332bba1001ae4a8ab","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Islam","answer_start":1035}],"question":"What religion was not at the center of education in the Ottoman Empire?","id":"5ace818332bba1001ae4a8ac","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"wide range of studies","answer_start":1976}],"question":" What did Ottoman madaris have that was different to modern American schools?","id":"5ace818332bba1001ae4a8ad","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Although Ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. \"The goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God.\" Religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. As \u0130nalc\u0131k mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" \u2013 key word being \"divine\". \u0130nalc\u0131k also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam.\" Hence, madaris \u2013 schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe \"Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.\" Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach \"proper religious values.\" This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on. Thus, Ottoman madaris were very similar to present day schools in the sense that they offered a wide range of studies; however, these studies, in their ultimate objective, aimed to further solidify and consolidate Islamic practices and theories."}]},"335":{"title":"Miami","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Along with West, Downtown and North, what is the other notable area of Miami?","id":"572a73f17a1753140016af90","answers":[{"text":"South","answer_start":71}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"By cardinal direction, what part of the city is referred to as Downtown?","id":"572a73f17a1753140016af91","answers":[{"text":"eastern","answer_start":163}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Along with Port Miami, Watson Island and Brickell, what area is in Downtown Miami?","id":"572a73f17a1753140016af92","answers":[{"text":"Virginia Key","answer_start":218}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"On what street is the highest concentration of international banks in the US?","id":"572a73f17a1753140016af93","answers":[{"text":"Brickell Avenue","answer_start":467}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where is South Beach in relation to Downtown?","id":"572a73f17a1753140016af94","answers":[{"text":"East","answer_start":644}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"South","answer_start":71}],"question":"Along with West, Downtown and North, what is the other unnotable area of Miami?","id":"5ad38355604f3c001a3fe4e7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"eastern","answer_start":163}],"question":"By cardinal direction, what part of the city isn't referred to as Downtown?","id":"5ad38355604f3c001a3fe4e8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Virginia Key","answer_start":218}],"question":"Along with Port Miami, Watson Island and Brickell, what area isn't in Downtown Miami?","id":"5ad38355604f3c001a3fe4e9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Brickell Avenue","answer_start":467}],"question":"On what street is the lowest concentration of international banks in the US?","id":"5ad38355604f3c001a3fe4ea","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"East","answer_start":644}],"question":"Where is South Beach in relation to Uptown?","id":"5ad38355604f3c001a3fe4eb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Miami is partitioned into many different sections, roughly into North, South, West and Downtown.

The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest monsoon winds off the Arabian Sea, as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a rain shadow. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of Jodhpur is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is Indias largest airbase and military, BSF bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur. The Northwestern thorn scrub forests lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400 mm of rain in an average year. Temperatures can exceed 48 \u00b0C in the summer months and drop below freezing in the winter. The Godwar, Marwar, and Shekhawati regions lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur. The Luni River and its tributaries are the major river system of Godwar and Marwar regions, draining the western slopes of the Aravallis and emptying southwest into the great Rann of Kutch wetland in neighboring Gujarat. This river is saline in the lower reaches and remains potable only up to Balotara in Barmer district. The Ghaggar River, which originates in Haryana, is an intermittent stream that disappears into the sands of the Thar Desert in the northern corner of the state and is seen as a remnant of the primitive Saraswati river."},{"qas":[{"question":"How many meters high is Guru Shikhar?","id":"572aa539111d821400f38c72","answers":[{"text":"1,722","answer_start":100}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What percentage of Rajasthan is to the northwest of the Aravalli range?","id":"572aa539111d821400f38c73","answers":[{"text":"60%","answer_start":181}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the average elevation of the south-eastern region of Rajasthan?","id":"572aa539111d821400f38c74","answers":[{"text":"100 to 350 m above sea level","answer_start":517}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"A tableland is contained within what to southeastern districts?","id":"572aa539111d821400f38c75","answers":[{"text":"Kota and Bundi","answer_start":699}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What river runs along the badlands in the northeast of Rajasthan","id":"572aa539111d821400f38c76","answers":[{"text":"the Chambal River","answer_start":821}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1,722 m in height","answer_start":100}],"question":"What is the elevation of Mewar?","id":"5a46df415fd40d001a27dcc1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast","answer_start":181}],"question":"How does Merta city divide the state?","id":"5a46df415fd40d001a27dcc2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"an alluvial basin","answer_start":945}],"question":"What are the plains of northeastern Mewar a part of?","id":"5a46df415fd40d001a27dcc3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Merta City","answer_start":964}],"question":"What city lies in the geographical center of the Thar Desert?","id":"5a46df415fd40d001a27dcc4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"sandy and unproductive with little water","answer_start":264}],"question":"What is the topography of the hilly tract of Khetri in the south?","id":"5a46df415fd40d001a27dcc5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak Guru Shikhar (Mount Abu), which is 1,722 m in height, to Khetri in the northeast.

Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a tabula rasa, a \"blank tablet\", in Locke's words \"white paper\", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which is very different from the quest for certainty of Descartes."},{"qas":[{"question":"What conclusion do most of Hume's followers disagree with?","id":"572b3ab4111d821400f38de4","answers":[{"text":"that belief in an external world is rationally unjustifiable","answer_start":60}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did Hume say can't be rationally justified?","id":"572b3ab4111d821400f38de5","answers":[{"text":"belief in an external world","answer_start":65}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is phenomenalism?","id":"572b3ab4111d821400f38de6","answers":[{"text":"physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events","answer_start":544}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is subjective idealism closely related to?","id":"572b3ab4111d821400f38de7","answers":[{"text":"Phenomenalism","answer_start":513}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did John Stuart Mill say matter is?","id":"572b3ab4111d821400f38de8","answers":[{"text":"the \"permanent possibility of sensation\"","answer_start":1154}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Hume and George Berkeley","answer_start":419}],"question":"Who founded the phenomenalism philosophy?","id":"5a57d3d8770dc0001aeefdd2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"mid-19th century","answer_start":1126}],"question":"When did DW Hamlin publish his essays?","id":"5a57d3d8770dc0001aeefdd3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Hume's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief","answer_start":138}],"question":"Why did John Stuart Mill disagree with Hume?","id":"5a57d3d8770dc0001aeefdd4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"mid-19th century","answer_start":1126}],"question":"When did Phenomenalism begin?","id":"5a57d3d8770dc0001aeefdd5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Hume's followers","answer_start":8}],"question":"Who argued for subjective idealism?","id":"5a57d3d8770dc0001aeefdd6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Most of Hume's followers have disagreed with his conclusion that belief in an external world is rationally unjustifiable, contending that Hume's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief, that is, beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct, custom and habit. According to an extreme empiricist theory known as phenomenalism, anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences. Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist \u2014 hence the closely related term subjective idealism. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences. This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As John Stuart Mill put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the \"permanent possibility of sensation\".

The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \"reality\" that goes beyond mere \"possibilities of sensation\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction."},{"qas":[{"question":"What phase of empiricism ended in the 1940s?","id":"572b40d0111d821400f38df6","answers":[{"text":"phenomenalist","answer_start":4}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How can't a finite set of statements be described?","id":"572b40d0111d821400f38df7","answers":[{"text":"in purely sensory terms","answer_start":736}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is necessary to explain a doctor's normality in sensory terms?","id":"572b40d0111d821400f38df8","answers":[{"text":"a second doctor","answer_start":1204}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1940s","answer_start":63}],"question":"When did the phenomenalist phase begin?","id":"5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1940s","answer_start":63}],"question":"When was the problem of the third man published?","id":"5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"purely sensory terms","answer_start":739}],"question":"How must a finite set of statements be described?","id":"5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"we must refer to a third doctor","answer_start":1502}],"question":"How many doctors do you need to satisfy the hypothetical problem?","id":"5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the former must be at least deducible from the latter","answer_start":307}],"question":"How did it become possible for physical object statements to translate into sense-data statements?","id":"5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfe","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data. If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former must be at least deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal.

This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies, they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the analytic (a priori) and the synthetic (a posteriori). On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called verification principle. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems."},{"qas":[{"question":"How long before Peirce did Hume write?","id":"572b441cf75d5e190021fd42","answers":[{"text":"a century","answer_start":230}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How did Peirce view inductive vs deductive reasoning?","id":"572b441cf75d5e190021fd43","answers":[{"text":"complementary","answer_start":97}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How did Hume view inductive vs deductive reasoning?","id":"572b441cf75d5e190021fd44","answers":[{"text":"competitive","answer_start":123}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did fallibilism say?","id":"572b441cf75d5e190021fd45","answers":[{"text":"the conclusions of science are always tentative","answer_start":752}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does the scientific method's rationality depend on?","id":"572b441cf75d5e190021fd46","answers":[{"text":"its self-corrective character","answer_start":902}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a century before","answer_start":230}],"question":"When was abductive reasoning added?","id":"5a57e7be770dc0001aeefea0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a century before","answer_start":230}],"question":"When was the doctrine of fallibilism published?","id":"5a57e7be770dc0001aeefea1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Peirce","answer_start":718}],"question":"Who said the doctrines of science are always definitive?","id":"5a57e7be770dc0001aeefea2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"continued application of the method science can detect and correct its own mistakes","answer_start":936}],"question":"Why does the scientific method rely on its certainty?","id":"5a57e7be770dc0001aeefea3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Among Peirce's major contributions was to place inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning in a complementary rather than competitive mode, the latter of which had been the primary trend among the educated since David Hume wrote a century before.

Peirce's approach \"presupposes that (1) the objects of knowledge are real things, (2) the characters (properties) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them, and (3) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them. According to Peirce's doctrine of fallibilism, the conclusions of science are always tentative.

Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical.

When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\" The picture Hegel presents is \"a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity.\""},{"qas":[{"question":"Who was a notable critic of Hegel?","id":"572b76f734ae481900deae2f","answers":[{"text":"Kierkegaard","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"For whom did Kierkegaard argue reality cannot be a system?","id":"572b76f734ae481900deae30","answers":[{"text":"human","answer_start":401}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"According to Kierkegaard, why can't reality be a system for human beings?","id":"572b76f734ae481900deae31","answers":[{"text":"humans are incomplete","answer_start":443}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Even though Kierkegaard does not believe in the possibility of an existential system of reality, what sort of system can exist?","id":"572b76f734ae481900deae32","answers":[{"text":"logical","answer_start":517}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Kierkegaard","answer_start":0}],"question":"Whose work did Hegel criticize?","id":"5a7c8e33e8bc7e001a9e1ed9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"existence and thought","answer_start":696}],"question":"What does Kierkegaard blur the lines between?","id":"5a7c8e33e8bc7e001a9e1eda","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"both reality and humans","answer_start":426}],"question":"Why did Kierkegaard believe humans could have a system for reality?","id":"5a7c8e33e8bc7e001a9e1edb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"existential","answer_start":551}],"question":"Kierkegaard said a logical system and what other system was possible?","id":"5a7c8e33e8bc7e001a9e1edc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a comprehensive system","answer_start":102}],"question":"What did Kierkegaard say could explain all of reality?","id":"5a7c8e33e8bc7e001a9e1edd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Kierkegaard criticised Hegel's idealist philosophy in several of his works, particularly his claim to a comprehensive system that could explain the whole of reality.

But the relation between time and eternity is outside time and this is the \"logical structure\" that Hegel thinks we can know. Kierkegaard disputes this assertion, because it eliminates the clear distinction between ontology and epistemology. Existence and thought are not identical and one cannot possibly think existence. Thought is always a form of abstraction, and thus not only is pure existence impossible to think, but all forms in existence are unthinkable; thought depends on language, which merely abstracts from experience, thus separating us from lived experience and the living essence of all beings. In addition, because we are finite beings, we cannot possibly know or understand anything that is universal or infinite such as God, so we cannot know God exists, since that which transcends time simultaneously transcends human understanding."},{"qas":[{"question":"Who wrote The Refutation of Idealism?","id":"572b78f434ae481900deae37","answers":[{"text":"Moore","answer_start":320}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In his rejection of idealism, whose thought did Moore attack?","id":"572b78f434ae481900deae38","answers":[{"text":"Bradley","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who originated the saying 'esse est percipi'?","id":"572b78f434ae481900deae39","answers":[{"text":"Berkeley","answer_start":1150}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Refutation of Idealism","answer_start":344}],"question":"What did Bradley write?","id":"5a7c9af5e8bc7e001a9e1ef7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the statement that something is real","answer_start":126}],"question":"What did Bradley say Moore did not understand?","id":"5a7c9af5e8bc7e001a9e1ef8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"esse est percipi","answer_start":504}],"question":"What Latin phrase did Moore coin?","id":"5a7c9af5e8bc7e001a9e1ef9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"GEM","answer_start":1196}],"question":"What argument did Moore validate?","id":"5a7c9af5e8bc7e001a9e1efa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"G.

Moore's radical rejection of idealism. Moore claimed that Bradley did not understand the statement that something is real. We know for certain, through common sense and prephilosophical beliefs, that some things are real, whether they are objects of thought or not, according to Moore. The 1903 article The Refutation of Idealism is one of the first demonstrations of Moore's commitment to analysis. He examines each of the three terms in the Berkeleian aphorism esse est percipi, \"to be is to be perceived\", finding that it must mean that the object and the subject are necessarily connected so that \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" are identical - \"to be yellow\" is \"to be experienced as yellow\". But it also seems there is a difference between \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" and \"that esse is held to be percipi, solely because what is experienced is held to be identical with the experience of it\". Though far from a complete refutation, this was the first strong statement by analytic philosophy against its idealist predecessors, or at any rate against the type of idealism represented by Berkeley. This argument did not show that the GEM (in post\u2013Stove vernacular, see below) is logically invalid."},{"qas":[{"question":"Who is a notable exponent of pluralistic idealism?","id":"572b7982be1ee31400cb83bd","answers":[{"text":"Gottfried Leibniz","answer_start":37}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the term for the type of idealism preached by Leibniz?","id":"572b7982be1ee31400cb83be","answers":[{"text":"Panpsychism","answer_start":388}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did Leibniz believe the universe is fundamentally composed of?","id":"572b7982be1ee31400cb83bf","answers":[{"text":"monads","answer_start":408}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was a notable disciple of Leibniz?","id":"572b7982be1ee31400cb83c0","answers":[{"text":"James Ward","answer_start":1060}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does Ward see as the purpose of interaction between monads?","id":"572b7982be1ee31400cb83c1","answers":[{"text":"self- betterment","answer_start":1248}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Christian Theism","answer_start":1001}],"question":"What form of thought rejected Leibniz's cosmology?","id":"5a7c9c44e8bc7e001a9e1f15","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"English","answer_start":1023}],"question":"What was Leibniz's nationality?","id":"5a7c9c44e8bc7e001a9e1f16","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Leibniz","answer_start":1083}],"question":"Who did James Ward inspire?","id":"5a7c9c44e8bc7e001a9e1f17","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Panpsychism","answer_start":388}],"question":"What form of idealism did Ward create?","id":"5a7c9c44e8bc7e001a9e1f18","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"absolute","answer_start":231}],"question":"Pluralistic idealism assumes the absolute in the same way what other form of idealism does?","id":"5a7c9c44e8bc7e001a9e1f19","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Pluralistic idealism such as that of Gottfried Leibniz takes the view that there are many individual minds that together underlie the existence of the observed world and make possible the existence of the physical universe.

Leibniz' form of idealism, known as Panpsychism, views \"monads\" as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception. The monads are \"substantial forms of being\",elemental, individual, subject to their own laws, non-interacting, each reflecting the entire universe. Monads are centers of force, which is substance while space, matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads. There is a pre-established harmony established by God, the central monad, between the world in the minds of the monads and the external world of objects. Leibniz's cosmology embraced traditional Christian Theism. The English psychologist and philosopher James Ward inspired by Leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism.

(The American game has a similar \"neutral zone\" but it is only the length of the football.)"},{"qas":[{"question":"Which Canadian football rules did the ORFU adopt in 1903?","id":"572e7f4603f98919007566d3","answers":[{"text":"Burnside","answer_start":4}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which three Canadian football unions resisted the Burnside Rules?","id":"572e7f4603f98919007566d4","answers":[{"text":"CIRFU, QRFU and CRU","answer_start":610}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which year did forward passes become acceptable in Canadian football?","id":"572e7f4603f98919007566d5","answers":[{"text":"1929","answer_start":730}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which style of North American football changed the rules of their game the most from their earliest versions?","id":"572e7f4603f98919007566d6","answers":[{"text":"American","answer_start":947}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"in 1903","answer_start":79}],"question":"When were the American rules incorporated?","id":"5a0f441adecec90018475539","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game","answer_start":114}],"question":"Why did the CIRFU create Burnside rules?","id":"5a0f441adecec9001847553a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1929","answer_start":730}],"question":"In what year did the American game allow forward passes?","id":"5a0f441adecec9001847553b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"12 men per side","answer_start":205}],"question":"What did the Canadian side reduce teams to per side?","id":"5a0f441adecec9001847553c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"rule changes","answer_start":972}],"question":"What difference did the Canadian side adopt before the American side?","id":"5a0f441adecec9001847553d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The Burnside rules closely resembling American Football that were incorporated in 1903 by The ORFU, was an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. The Burnside Rules had teams reduced to 12 men per side, introduced the Snap-Back system, required the offensive team to gain 10 yards on three downs, eliminated the Throw-In from the sidelines, allowed only six men on the line, stated that all goals by kicking were to be worth two points and the opposition was to line up 10 yards from the defenders on all kicks. The rules were an attempt to standardize the rules throughout the country. The CIRFU, QRFU and CRU refused to adopt the new rules at first. Forward passes were not allowed in the Canadian game until 1929, and touchdowns, which had been five points, were increased to six points in 1956, in both cases several decades after the Americans had adopted the same changes. The primary differences between the Canadian and American games stem from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side did not (originally, both sides had three downs, goal posts on the goal lines and unlimited forward motion, but the American side modified these rules and the Canadians did not). The Canadian field width was one rule that was not based on American rules, as the Canadian game played in wider fields and stadiums that were not as narrow as the American stadiums."},{"qas":[{"question":"How many yards wide is a Canadian football field?","id":"572e844703f989190075670b","answers":[{"text":"65","answer_start":58}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How long in meters is the crossbar of a Canadian football goal?","id":"572e844703f989190075670c","answers":[{"text":"5.6","answer_start":278}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What part of a Canadian football field was sometimes marked with a \"G\"?","id":"572e844703f989190075670d","answers":[{"text":"goal line","answer_start":1200}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What distance from the sidelines are hash marks painted on a CFL field?","id":"572e844703f989190075670e","answers":[{"text":"24 yards (21.9 m)","answer_start":1396}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Canadian football","answer_start":4}],"question":"Whose football fields are hundred 50 yards wide and 65 yards long?","id":"5a0e220fd7c8500018864541","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The sides of the field","answer_start":596}],"question":"What are marked with yellow sidelines?","id":"5a0e220fd7c8500018864542","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"fields that have a surrounding running track","answer_start":1437}],"question":"What fields have expanded in zones?","id":"5a0e220fd7c8500018864543","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"among U.S.-based teams","answer_start":1725}],"question":"Where was it uncommon to put her over the track?","id":"5a0e220fd7c8500018864544","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-yard lines are marked with numbers","answer_start":1124}],"question":"In most running tracks today, what are marked?","id":"5a0f51d4decec90018475561","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the tuning-fork design","answer_start":445}],"question":"In higher calibre stadiums what is preferred?","id":"5a0f51d4decec90018475562","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"yard lines","answer_start":811}],"question":"What single-curved post lines drawn every 5 yards from the goal line called?","id":"5a0f51d4decec90018475563","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"24 yards (21.9 m)","answer_start":1396}],"question":"How far from the goalposts are hashmarks painted?","id":"5a0f51d4decec90018475564","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the end zones","answer_start":1552}],"question":"What is cut off to accommodate the yard lines at Commonwealth Stadium?","id":"5a0f51d4decec90018475565","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The Canadian football field is 150 yards (137 m) long and 65 yards (59 m) wide with end zones 20 yards (18 m) deep, and goal lines 110 yards (101 m) apart.

The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts 10 feet (3 m) above the ground) is preferred. The sides of the field are marked by white sidelines, the goal line is marked in white, and white lines are drawn laterally across the field every 5 yards (4.6 m) from the goal line. These lateral lines are called \"yard lines\" and often marked with the distance in yards from and an arrow pointed toward the nearest goal line. In previous decades, arrows were not used and every yard line was usually marked with the distance to the goal line, including the goal line itself which was marked with a \"0\"; in most stadiums today, the 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-yard lines are marked with numbers, with the goal line sometimes being marked with a \"G\". The centre (55-yard) line usually is marked with a \"C\". \"Hash marks\" are painted in white, parallel to the yardage lines, at 1 yard (0.9 m) intervals, 24 yards (21.9 m) from the sidelines. On fields that have a surrounding running track, such as Commonwealth Stadium, Molson Stadium, and many universities, the end zones are often cut off in the corners to accommodate the track. In 2014, Edmonton placed turf over the track to create full end zones. This was particularly common among U.S.-based teams during the CFL's American expansion, where few American stadiums were able to accommodate the much longer and noticeably wider CFL field."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the term for play stopped because the ball carrier, although not fully tackled, can no longer advance the ball?","id":"572e8686c246551400ce42c2","answers":[{"text":"forward progress","answer_start":454}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does the next play start unless a team has just scored?","id":"572e8686c246551400ce42c3","answers":[{"text":"scrimmage","answer_start":526}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which parts of the ball carrier's body do not cause play to stop when they touch the ground?","id":"572e8686c246551400ce42c4","answers":[{"text":"feet and hands","answer_start":86}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which direction of pass causes play to stop when it is not caught?","id":"572e8686c246551400ce42c5","answers":[{"text":"forward","answer_start":145}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the next play","answer_start":500}],"question":"If a player's knee is forced to the ground, what starts from scrimmage?","id":"5a0f5627decec90018475575","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"feet and hands","answer_start":86}],"question":"What parts of the ball carriers forward progress won't stop play when touching the ground?","id":"5a0f5627decec90018475576","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"forwards","answer_start":437}],"question":"Which touchdown causes play to stop when not caught?","id":"5a0f5627decec90018475577","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"scrimmage","answer_start":526}],"question":"Where does the next field goal start unless a team has scored?","id":"5a0f5627decec90018475578","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"forward progress","answer_start":454}],"question":"What means play stopped because the ball carrier can move forward?","id":"5a0f5627decec90018475579","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Play stops when the ball carrier's knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a tackle); when a forward pass is not caught on the fly (during a scrimmage); when a touchdown (see below) or a field goal is scored; when the ball leaves the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in a standing position but can no longer move forwards (called forward progress).

Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death."},{"qas":[{"question":"Feyman's experience on the Rogers Commission was talked about is which of his books?","id":"572e8f2edfa6aa1500f8d133","answers":[{"text":"What Do You Care What Other People Think?","answer_start":44}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which way did he write about his experience on the Rogers Commission?","id":"572e8f2edfa6aa1500f8d134","answers":[{"text":"sober narrative","answer_start":226}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"His writings about the Rogers Commission showed that trouble was brewing between scientists and executives at which prolific institute?","id":"572e8f2edfa6aa1500f8d135","answers":[{"text":"NASA","answer_start":385}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"While the higher-ups said a failure was unlikely, at 1 in 100,000 odds, the scientists felt the odd were what?","id":"572e8f2edfa6aa1500f8d136","answers":[{"text":"1 in 200","answer_start":694}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who did NASA recruit by using flawed safety numbers?","id":"572e8f2edfa6aa1500f8d137","answers":[{"text":"Christa McAuliffe","answer_start":883}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"What Do You Care What Other People Think?","answer_start":44}],"question":"What book ignored Feynman's experience on the Rogers Commission?","id":"5a8dde3adf8bba001a0f9ccb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"sober narrative","answer_start":226}],"question":"Which way did he avoid writing about his experience on the Rogers Commission?","id":"5a8dde3adf8bba001a0f9ccc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"NASA managers","answer_start":489}],"question":"What managers claimed there was a 1 in 10,000 chance of catastrophic failure aboard the shuttle?","id":"5a8dde3adf8bba001a0f9ccd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Christa McAuliffe","answer_start":883}],"question":"Who did NASA recruit while using accurate safety numbers?","id":"5a8dde3adf8bba001a0f9cce","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Feynman","answer_start":0}],"question":"Who concluded that NASA management was fantastically realistic?","id":"5a8dde3adf8bba001a0f9ccf","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Feynman devoted the latter half of his book What Do You Care What Other People Think? to his experience on the Rogers Commission, straying from his usual convention of brief, light-hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative.

The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces. Many African nations had tired of Libya's policies of interference in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine African states had cut off diplomatic relations with Libya, while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli in order to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship. Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two governments. Relations remained strained, particularly due to Morocco's friendly relations with the U.S. and Israel; in August 1986, Hassan abolished the union.

In Operation El Dorado Canyon, orchestrated on 15 April 1986, U.S. military planes launched a series of air-strikes on Libya, bombing military installations in various parts of the country, killing around 100 Libyans, including several civilians.

Restrictions were placed on the activities of the Revolutionary Committees; in March 1988, their role was narrowed by the newly created Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership to restrict their violence and judicial role, while in August 1988 Gaddafi publicly criticised them, asserting that \"they deviated, harmed, tortured\" and that \"the true revolutionary does not practise repression.\" In March, hundreds of political prisoners were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming that there were no further political prisoners in Libya. In June, Libya's government issued the Great Green Charter on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses, in which 27 articles laid out goals, rights and guarantees to improve the situation of human rights in Libya, restricting the use of the death penalty and calling for its eventual abolition.

Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record.

According to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's administration, due to his government's pervasive surveillance of civilians. Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by western commentators as \"a police state\". Opponents were critical of Libya's human rights abuses; according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others, hundreds of arrested political opponents often failed to receive a fair trial, and were sometimes subjected to torture or extrajudicial execution, most notably in the Abu Salim prison, including an alleged massacre on 29 June 1996 in which HRW estimated that 1,270 prisoners were massacred. Dissidents abroad or \"stray dogs\" were also publicly threatened with death and sometimes killed by government hit squads. His government's treatment of non-Arab Libyans has also came in for criticism from human rights activists, with native Berbers, Italians, Jews, refugees, and foreign workers all facing persecution in Gaddafist Libya. According to journalist Annick Cojean and psychologist Seham Sergewa, Gaddafi and senior officials raped and imprisoned hundreds or thousands of young women and reportedly raped several of his female bodyguards. Gaddafi's government was frequently criticized for not being democratic, with Freedom House consistently giving Libya under Gaddafi the \"Not Free\" ranking for civil liberties and political rights."}]},"350":{"title":"Cyprus","paragraphs":[]},"351":{"title":"Steven_Spielberg","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"How many TV films did Universal sign Spielbergo to direct?","id":"572e9600c246551400ce4396","answers":[{"text":"four","answer_start":68}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What British critic helped boost Steven Spielberg's career?","id":"572e9600c246551400ce4397","answers":[{"text":"Dilys Powell","answer_start":377}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who starred in the TV show \"Savage\"?","id":"572e9600c246551400ce4398","answers":[{"text":"Martin Landau","answer_start":712}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How did Steven Spielberg's film \"The Sugarland Express\" do in the box office?","id":"572e9600c246551400ce4399","answers":[{"text":"poorly","answer_start":1081}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What were the married couple in Steven Spielberg's film \"The Sugarland Express\" trying to regain?","id":"572e9600c246551400ce439a","answers":[{"text":"custody of their baby","answer_start":875}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many TV movies was Spielberg signed to direct?","id":"57318dc8a5e9cc1400cdc061","answers":[{"text":"four","answer_start":68}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kind of truck was 'Duel' about?","id":"57318dc8a5e9cc1400cdc062","answers":[{"text":"Peterbilt 281 tanker","answer_start":170}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which British critic praised 'Duel'?","id":"57318dc8a5e9cc1400cdc063","answers":[{"text":"Dilys Powell","answer_start":377}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which TV film Spielberg directed played off 'The Exorcist'?","id":"57318dc8a5e9cc1400cdc064","answers":[{"text":"Something Evil","answer_start":453}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who starred in 'Savage'\/","id":"57318dc8a5e9cc1400cdc065","answers":[{"text":"Martin Landau","answer_start":712}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Dennis Weaver","answer_start":237}],"question":"Who starred in Duel as the tanker truck driver?","id":"5ad4b0075b96ef001a109d94","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Martin Landau","answer_start":712}],"question":"Who starred in Something Evil?","id":"5ad4b0075b96ef001a109d95","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Dennis Weaver","answer_start":237}],"question":"Who starred as the father in The Sugarland Express?","id":"5ad4b0075b96ef001a109d96","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a psychotic Peterbilt 281 tanker truck driver","answer_start":158}],"question":"What was the tv movie Savage about?","id":"5ad4b0075b96ef001a109d97","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Dilys Powell","answer_start":377}],"question":"Who starred as the mother in The Sugarland Express?","id":"5ad4b0075b96ef001a109d98","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Based on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films.

Special praise of this film by the influential British critic Dilys Powell was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (Something Evil) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of The Exorcist, then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called Savage, starring Martin Landau. Spielberg's debut full-length feature film was The Sugarland Express, about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby.

According to Warren Buckland, these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Empire of the Sun, Jurassic Park, etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like Munich, Saving Private Ryan, The Terminal, Minority Report, and Amistad. If one views each of his films, one will see this shot utilized by the director, notably the water scenes in Jaws are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In Empire of the Sun, Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in Catch Me If You Can, Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them."},{"qas":[{"question":"What was Indy's father's career?","id":"5731cbbce99e3014001e6296","answers":[{"text":"professor of medieval literature","answer_start":549}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What artifact did Indy's father focus on?","id":"5731cbbce99e3014001e6297","answers":[{"text":"the Holy Grail","answer_start":671}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is Spielberg's most common theme?","id":"5731cbbce99e3014001e6298","answers":[{"text":"tension in parent-child relationships","answer_start":50}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Whose son disappeared in 'Minority Report'?","id":"5731cbbce99e3014001e6299","answers":[{"text":"John Anderton","answer_start":1183}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Whose parents divorced in 'Catch Me If You Can'?","id":"5731cbbce99e3014001e629a","answers":[{"text":"Frank Abagnale","answer_start":1664}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Tim","answer_start":1994}],"question":"Who is one of the main characters of Jurassic Park?","id":"5ad4d6215b96ef001a10a2ac","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"father","answer_start":853}],"question":"What was Oskar Schindler in real life?","id":"5ad4d6215b96ef001a10a2ad","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"professor of medieval literature","answer_start":549}],"question":"What did Indiana Jones do for a living?","id":"5ad4d6215b96ef001a10a2ae","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"professor of medieval literature","answer_start":549}],"question":"What occupation was Avner in Munich?","id":"5ad4d6215b96ef001a10a2af","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in Hook starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children. The notable absence of Elliott's father in E.T., is the most famous example of this theme. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son \"self reliance,\" which is not how Indy saw it). Even Oskar Schindler, from Schindler's List, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. Munich depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in Jaws is a committed family man, while John Anderton in Minority Report is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and Catch Me If You Can (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in Jurassic Park (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which film did Kathleen Kennedy first work with Spielberg on?","id":"5731cca5e17f3d1400422409","answers":[{"text":"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial","answer_start":238}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which childhood friend worked on Spielberg's films?","id":"5731cca5e17f3d140042240a","answers":[{"text":"Allen Daviau","answer_start":308}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which film did Kaminski first work with Spielberg on?","id":"5731cca5e17f3d140042240b","answers":[{"text":"Schindler's List","answer_start":502}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which film did Daviau first work with Spielberg on?","id":"5731cca5e17f3d140042240c","answers":[{"text":"Amblin","answer_start":392}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which film did Kahn first work with Spielberg on?","id":"5731cca5e17f3d140042240d","answers":[{"text":"Close Encounters","answer_start":669}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial","answer_start":238}],"question":"What was the first movie Kathleen Kennedy produced?","id":"5ad4d7b05b96ef001a10a308","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Amblin","answer_start":392}],"question":"What movie did Allen Daviau first work on as a cinematographer?","id":"5ad4d7b05b96ef001a10a309","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Schindler's List","answer_start":502}],"question":"What was the first movie Janusz Kaminski ever shot?","id":"5ad4d7b05b96ef001a10a30a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Close Encounters","answer_start":669}],"question":"What was the first film Michael Kahn ever edited?","id":"5ad4d7b05b96ef001a10a30b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Schindler's List","answer_start":502}],"question":"For what movie did Laurent Bouzereau complete his first documentary?","id":"5ad4d7b05b96ef001a10a30c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Spielberg prefers working with production members with whom he has developed an existing working relationship.

The grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping. \"Traction\" is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave, thereby the name. As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear, some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced. Sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension, thus sharing the load evenly. Rope tension equalization may be achieved using a rope tension gauge, and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes."},{"qas":[{"question":"What initiates Phase one mode?","id":"572ec87ac246551400ce4674","answers":[{"text":"a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building","answer_start":31}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happens when an elevator goes into Phase one mode?","id":"572ec87ac246551400ce4675","answers":[{"text":"The elevator will wait an amount of time, then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor","answer_start":177}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does the elevator go from there?","id":"572ec87ac246551400ce4676","answers":[{"text":"the elevator will go to the fire-recall floor","answer_start":388}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happens if the mode is activated on the fire-recall floor?","id":"572ec87ac246551400ce4677","answers":[{"text":"the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to","answer_start":497}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How is the elevator enabled for service after the incident?","id":"572ec87ac246551400ce4678","answers":[{"text":"The only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset","answer_start":899}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Phase one mode is activated by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building.

Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related \u2014 for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors. In fact, prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant \u2014 the elevator operator. However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged. This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis. In addition, a oil\/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil\/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact. However, In Thailand, in November 2012, a woman was killed in free falling elevator, in what was reported as the \"first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift\"."},{"qas":[{"question":"Underground electrolytic malfunctions in hydraulic elevators can result in the destruction of what?

Single bulkhead cylinders, typically built prior to a 1972 ASME A17.1 Elevator Safety Code change requiring a second dished bulkhead, were subject to possible catastrophic failure. The code previously permitted only single-bottom hydraulic cylinders. In the event of a cylinder breach, the fluid loss results in uncontrolled down movement of the elevator. This creates two significant hazards: being subject to an impact at the bottom when the elevator stops suddenly and being in the entrance for a potential shear if the rider is partly in the elevator. Because it is impossible to verify the system at all times, the code requires periodic testing of the pressure capability. Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a plunger gripping device. One commercially available is known by the marketing name \"LifeJacket\". This is a device which, in the event of an uncontrolled downward acceleration, nondestructively grips the plunger and stops the car. A device known as an overspeed or rupture valve is attached to the hydraulic inlet\/outlet of the cylinder and is adjusted for a maximum flow rate. If a pipe or hose were to break (rupture), the flow rate of the rupture valve will surpass a set limit and mechanically stop the outlet flow of hydraulic fluid, thus stopping the plunger and the car in the down direction."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the main function of direction lanterns?","id":"572f010ddfa6aa1500f8d551","answers":[{"text":"to help people decide whether or not to get on the elevator","answer_start":153}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What might change your mind about whether or not to enter an elevator?","id":"572f010ddfa6aa1500f8d552","answers":[{"text":"If somebody waiting for the elevator wants to go up, but a car comes first that indicates that it is going down","answer_start":214}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of etching might you see on a direction indicator?","id":"572f010ddfa6aa1500f8d553","answers":[{"text":"arrows or shaped like arrows","answer_start":485}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Some elevators may use the color convention for only what purpose?","id":"572f010ddfa6aa1500f8d554","answers":[{"text":"to differentiate between directions","answer_start":841}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Direction lanterns are also found both inside and outside elevator cars, but they should always be visible from outside because their primary purpose is to help people decide whether or not to get on the elevator.

Direction indicators are sometimes etched with arrows or shaped like arrows and\/or use the convention that one that lights up red means \"down\" and green means \"up\". Since the color convention is often undermined or overridden by systems that do not invoke it, it is usually used only in conjunction with other differentiating factors. An example of a place whose elevators use only the color convention to differentiate between directions is the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, where a single circle can be made to light up green for \"up\" and red for \"down\".

At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is Neptune's atmosphere made of?

This scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails."}]},"355":{"title":"Spanish_language_in_the_United_States","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"When did the Venezuelans emigrate to the united states?","id":"572eb7eddfa6aa1500f8d309","answers":[{"text":"Until the 20th century, there was no clear record of the number of Venezuelans who emigrated to the United States.","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Does Venezuela have immigrates from other countries?","id":"572eb7eddfa6aa1500f8d30a","answers":[{"text":"Between the 18th and early 19th centuries, there were many European immigrants who went to Venezuela","answer_start":115}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Why did Venezuelans come to America?","id":"572eb7eddfa6aa1500f8d30b","answers":[{"text":"Many Venezuelans settled in the United States with hopes of receiving a better education, only to remain in there following graduation.","answer_start":537}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":" Do Venezuelans still come to America for the same reasons as they did before?","id":"572eb7eddfa6aa1500f8d30c","answers":[{"text":"since the early 1980s, the reasons for Venezuelan emigration have changed to include hopes of earning a higher salary","answer_start":723}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the 20th century","answer_start":6}],"question":"When did the Venezuelans emmigrate to Mexico?","id":"5a773af22d6d7f001a4a9f63","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"with hopes of receiving a better education","answer_start":583}],"question":"Why did Europeans come to America?","id":"5a773af22d6d7f001a4a9f64","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"early 1980s","answer_start":733}],"question":"Since when has European immigration included hopes of a higher salary?","id":"5a773af22d6d7f001a4a9f65","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"over 4,000","answer_start":399}],"question":"How many South Americans emigrated to Mexico from 1910 to 1930?","id":"5a773af22d6d7f001a4a9f66","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Between the 18th and early 19th centuries","answer_start":115}],"question":"When did Europenan immigrants go to Venezuela and later to Mexico?","id":"5a773af22d6d7f001a4a9f67","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Until the 20th century, there was no clear record of the number of Venezuelans who emigrated to the United States.

The rapidly disappearing \"Charleston accent\" is still noted in the local pronunciation of the city's name. Some elderly (and usually upper-class) Charleston natives ignore the 'r' and elongate the first vowel, pronouncing the name as \"Chah-l-ston\".

Vacuum is primarily measured by its absolute pressure, but a complete characterization requires further parameters, such as temperature and chemical composition. One of the most important parameters is the mean free path (MFP) of residual gases, which indicates the average distance that molecules will travel between collisions with each other. As the gas density decreases, the MFP increases, and when the MFP is longer than the chamber, pump, spacecraft, or other objects present, the continuum assumptions of fluid mechanics do not apply. This vacuum state is called high vacuum, and the study of fluid flows in this regime is called particle gas dynamics. The MFP of air at atmospheric pressure is very short, 70 nm, but at 100 mPa (~6997100000000000000\u26601\u00d710\u22123 Torr) the MFP of room temperature air is roughly 100 mm, which is on the order of everyday objects such as vacuum tubes.

The gas may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Swelling and ebullism can be restrained by containment in a flight suit.

Its first widespread use was in the incandescent light bulb to protect the filament from chemical degradation. The chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for electron beam welding, cold welding, vacuum packing and vacuum frying. Ultra-high vacuum is used in the study of atomically clean substrates, as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time (on the order of minutes to days). High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air, allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination. This is the principle behind chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and dry etching which are essential to the fabrication of semiconductors and optical coatings, and to surface science. The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of thermos bottles. Deep vacuum lowers the boiling point of liquids and promotes low temperature outgassing which is used in freeze drying, adhesive preparation, distillation, metallurgy, and process purging. The electrical properties of vacuum make electron microscopes and vacuum tubes possible, including cathode ray tubes. The elimination of air friction is useful for flywheel energy storage and ultracentrifuges."}]},"360":{"title":"Han_dynasty","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"How many family members would commonly live in a single household during the Han era?","id":"572ef06703f9891900756af5","answers":[{"text":"four to five","answer_start":53}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Whose opinion on the spouse of an arranged marriage was considered to be more important?","id":"572ef06703f9891900756af6","answers":[{"text":"the father's","answer_start":501}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who were rich enough to afford multiple lovers?","id":"572ef06703f9891900756af7","answers":[{"text":"nobles and high officials","answer_start":645}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of family was your typical Han era family considered to be?","id":"572ef06703f9891900756af8","answers":[{"text":"patrilineal","answer_start":23}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of marriage was thought of as a normal occurrence in this era?","id":"572ef06703f9891900756af9","answers":[{"text":"Arranged marriages","answer_start":464}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"The Han-era family was patrilineal and typically had four to five nuclear family members living in one household.

It is related that some of the Quraysh who were taken prisoners at the battle of Badr regained their freedom after they had taught some of the Muslims the simple writing of the time. Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate. As it was initially spoken, the Quran was recorded on tablets, bones, and the wide, flat ends of date palm fronds. Most suras were in use amongst early Muslims since they are mentioned in numerous sayings by both Sunni and Shia sources, relating Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, the making of prayer and the manner of recitation.

Zayd ibn Thabit (d. 655) was the person to collect the Quran since \"he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle\". Thus, a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd, collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died. Zayd's reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin stones and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives. After Abu Bakr, Hafsa bint Umar, Muhammad's widow, was entrusted with the manuscript. In about 650, the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (d. 656) began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Quran. Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed to written form. That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed.

The concept of inimitability originates in the Quran where in five different verses opponents are challenged to produce something like the Quran: \"If men and sprites banded together to produce the like of this Quran they would never produce its like not though they backed one another.\" So the suggestion is that if there are doubts concerning the divine authorship of the Quran, come forward and create something like it. From the ninth century, numerous works appeared which studied the Quran and examined its style and content. Medieval Muslim scholars including al-Jurjani (d. 1078) and al-Baqillani (d. 1013) have written treatises on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the Quran. Others argue that the Quran contains noble ideas, has inner meanings, maintained its freshness through the ages and has caused great transformations in individual level and in the history.

These works include material from Sulami's books plus the author's contributions. Many works are written in Persian such as the works of Maybudi (d. 1135) kash al-asrar (\"the unveiling of the secrets\"). Rumi (d. 1273) wrote a vast amount of mystical poetry in his book Mathnawi. Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in translations of Rumi's work. A large number of Quranic passages can be found in Mathnawi, which some consider a kind of Sufi interpretation of the Quran. Rumi's book is not exceptional for containing citations from and elaboration on the Quran, however, Rumi does mention Quran more frequently. Simnani (d. 1336) wrote two influential works of esoteric exegesis on the Quran. He reconciled notions of God's manifestation through and in the physical world with the sentiments of Sunni Islam. Comprehensive Sufi commentaries appear in the 18th century such as the work of Ismail Hakki Bursevi (d. 1725). His work ruh al-Bayan (the Spirit of Elucidation) is a voluminous exegesis.

In Tabatabaei's view, what has been rightly called ta'wil, or hermeneutic interpretation of the Quran, is not concerned simply with the denotation of words. Rather, it is concerned with certain truths and realities that transcend the comprehension of the common run of men; yet it is from these truths and realities that the principles of doctrine and the practical injunctions of the Quran issue forth.

Solid State Physics Group leader William Shockley saw the potential in this, and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of semiconductors. The term transistor was coined by John R. Pierce as a contraction of the term transresistance.

Having unearthed Lilienfeld\u2019s patents that went into obscurity years earlier, lawyers at Bell Labs advised against Shockley's proposal because the idea of a field-effect transistor that used an electric field as a \"grid\" was not new. Instead, what Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley invented in 1947 was the first point-contact transistor.

For liberal humanists such as Rousseau and Kant, the universal law of reason guided the way toward total emancipation from any kind of tyranny. These ideas were challenged, for example by the young Karl Marx, who criticized the project of political emancipation (embodied in the form of human rights), asserting it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it was supposed to oppose. For Friedrich Nietzsche, humanism was nothing more than a secular version of theism. In his Genealogy of Morals, he argues that human rights exist as a means for the weak to collectively constrain the strong. On this view, such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life, but rather deny it.

For instance, a vertical whip antenna or Wi-Fi antenna vertically oriented will transmit and receive in the vertical polarization. Antennas with horizontal elements, such as most rooftop TV antennas in the United States, are horizontally polarized (broadcast TV in the U.S. usually uses horizontal polarization).

In linear polarization the electric field of the radio wave oscillates back and forth along one direction; this can be affected by the mounting of the antenna but usually the desired direction is either horizontal or vertical polarization. In circular polarization, the electric field (and magnetic field) of the radio wave rotates at the radio frequency circularly around the axis of propagation.

However this understanding does not apply to resonant antennas where the resistance involved is the radiation resistance, a desired quantity which removes energy from the resonant element in order to radiate it (the purpose of an antenna, after all!). The Q is a measure of the ratio of reactance to resistance, so with a fixed radiation resistance (an element's radiation resistance is almost independent of its diameter) a greater reactance off-resonance corresponds to the poorer bandwidth of a very thin conductor. The Q of such a narrowband antenna can be as high as 15. On the other hand, a thick element presents less reactance at an off-resonant frequency, and consequently a Q as low as 5.

However, the resulting resistive impedance achieved will be quite a bit lower than the impedance of a resonant monopole, likely requiring further impedance matching. In addition to a lower radiation resistance, the reactance becomes higher as the antenna size is reduced, and the resonant circuit formed by the antenna and the tuning coil has a Q factor that rises and eventually causes the bandwidth of the antenna to be inadequate for the signal being transmitted.

This can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength or two of the ground. But as the antenna height is increased, the reduced power of the reflected wave (due to the inverse square law) allows the antenna to approach its asymptotic feedpoint impedance given by theory. At lower heights, the effect on the antenna's impedance is very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground, as this affects the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in the antenna.

As the pollen tube grows, it makes its way from the stigma, down the style and into the ovary. Here the pollen tube reaches the micropyle of the ovule and digests its way into one of the synergids, releasing its contents (which include the sperm cells). The synergid that the cells were released into degenerates and one sperm makes its way to fertilize the egg cell, producing a diploid (2n) zygote. The second sperm cell fuses with both central cell nuclei, producing a triploid (3n) cell.

Other films that show significant exterior shots of Santa Monica include Fletch (1985), Species (1995), Get Shorty (1995), and Ocean's Eleven (2001).

Traditionally, the distinction between acute and chronic pain has relied upon an arbitrary interval of time from onset; the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since the onset of pain, though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at 12 months.:93 Others apply acute to pain that lasts less than 30 days, chronic to pain of more than six months' duration, and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months.

Those pains which mean certain death when ignored will become the most powerfully felt. The relative intensities of pain, then, may resemble the relative importance of that risk to our ancestors (lack of food, too much cold, or serious injuries are felt as agony, whereas minor damage is felt as mere discomfort). This resemblance will not be perfect, however, because natural selection can be a poor designer. The result is often glitches in animals, including supernormal stimuli.

However, like infants (Latin infans meaning \"unable to speak\"), animals cannot answer questions about whether they feel pain; thus the defining criterion for pain in humans cannot be applied to them. Philosophers and scientists have responded to this difficulty in a variety of ways. Ren\u00e9 Descartes for example argued that animals lack consciousness and therefore do not experience pain and suffering in the way that humans do. Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals, writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain. In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to \"prove\" that animals are conscious, and to provide \"scientifically acceptable\" grounds for claiming that they feel pain. Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view. Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal, noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support, some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined. The ability of invertebrate species of animals, such as insects, to feel pain and suffering is also unclear."}]},"374":{"title":"Database","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"How long can it take to create a DBMS?","id":"572f5ebd947a6a140053c8c8","answers":[{"text":"thousands of human years","answer_start":89}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Name three DBMSs that have been used since the 1970s.","id":"572f5ebd947a6a140053c8c9","answers":[{"text":"Adabas, Oracle and DB2","answer_start":175}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How is the cost to create a DBMS distributed?","id":"572f5ebd947a6a140053c8ca","answers":[{"text":"spread over a large number of users","answer_start":409}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Name an example of a general-purpose DBMS.","id":"572f5ebd947a6a140053c8cb","answers":[{"text":"an email system","answer_start":748}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"thousands of human years","answer_start":89}],"question":"How long can it take to search for a DBMS?","id":"5a8c30bafd22b3001a8d8623","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Adabas, Oracle and DB2","answer_start":175}],"question":"What are three DBMSs that have been used during the 1960s?","id":"5a8c30bafd22b3001a8d8624","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"spread over a large number of users","answer_start":409}],"question":"How is the cost to remove a DBMS distributed?","id":"5a8c30bafd22b3001a8d8625","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a general-purpose DBMS","answer_start":514}],"question":"What is always the optimal solution to manage databases?","id":"5a8c30bafd22b3001a8d8626","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"A DBMS has evolved into a complex software system and its development typically requires thousands of human years of development effort.[a] Some general-purpose DBMSs such as Adabas, Oracle and DB2 have been undergoing upgrades since the 1970s.

A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look in the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database)."}]},"375":{"title":"Tucson,_Arizona","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What date did William Whitney Brazelton Die?

Most notable, however, were the two holdups committed by masked road-agent William Whitney Brazelton. Brazelton held up two stages in the summer of 1878 near Point of Mountain Station approximately 17 mi (27 km) northwest of Tucson. John Clum, of Tombstone, Arizona fame was one of the passengers. Brazelton was eventually tracked down and killed on Monday August 19, 1878, in a mesquite bosque along the Santa Cruz River 3 miles (5 km) south of Tucson by Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell and his citizen's posse. Brazelton had been suspected of highway robbery not only in the Tucson area, but also in the Prescott region and Silver City, New Mexico area as well. Brazelton's crimes prompted John J. Valentine, Sr. of Wells, Fargo & Co. to send special agent and future Pima County sheriff Bob Paul to investigate. Fort Lowell, then east of Tucson, was established to help protect settlers from Apache attacks. In 1882, Frank Stilwell was implicated in the murder of Morgan Earp by Cowboy Pete Spence's wife, Marietta, at the coroner's inquest on Morgan Earp's shooting.

Although bacterial fossils exist, such as stromatolites, their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution, or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species. However, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny, and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal\/eukaryotic lineage. Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes. Here, eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells, which were themselves possibly related to the Archaea. This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alphaproteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes, which are still found in all known Eukarya (sometimes in highly reduced form, e.g. in ancient \"amitochondrial\" protozoa). Later on, some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacterial-like organisms. This led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants. There are also some algae that originated from even later endosymbiotic events. Here, eukaryotes engulfed a eukaryotic algae that developed into a \"second-generation\" plastid.

Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions are considered to be nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue. Gas vacuoles, which are freely permeable to gas, are membrane-bound vesicles present in some species of Cyanobacteria. They allow the bacteria to control their buoyancy.

The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, also known as the logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport.

The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an area in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, the location of the great deluge of Deucalion, a land occupied by the Selloi and the \"Greeks\" who later came to be known as \"Hellenes\". Selloi were the priests of Dodonian Zeus and the word probably means \"sacrificers\" (compare Gothic saljan, \"present, sacrifice\"). There is currently no satisfactory etymology of the name Hellenes. Some scholars assert that the name Selloi changed to Sellanes and then to Hellanes-Hellenes. However this etymology connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain.

Hellen was the son of Deucalion who ruled around Phthia in central Greece. The Parian Chronicle mentions that when Deucalion became king of Phthia, the previously called Graikoi were named Hellenes. Aristotle notes that the Hellenes were related with Grai\/Greeks (Meteorologica I.xiv) a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus which was used by the Illyrians. He also claims that the great deluge must have occurred in the region around Dodona, where the Selloi dwelt. However, according to the Greek tradition it is more possible that the homeland of the Greeks was originally in central Greece. A modern theory derives the name Greek (Latin Graeci) from Graikos, \"inhabitant of Graia\/Graea,\" a town on the coast of Boeotia. Greek colonists from Graia helped to found Cumae (900 BC) in Italy, where they were called Graeces. When the Romans encountered them they used this name for the colonists and then for all Greeks (Graeci.) The word \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1 graia \"old woman\" comes from the PIE root *\u01f5erh2-\/*\u01f5reh2-, \"to grow old\" via Proto-Greek *gera-\/grau-iu; the same root later gave \u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 geras (\/keras\/), \"gift of honour\" in Mycenean Greek. The Germanic languages borrowed the word Greeks with an initial \"k\" sound which probably was their initial sound closest to the Latin \"g\" at the time (Goth. Kreks). The area out of ancient Attica including Boeotia was called Gra\u00efke and is connected with the older deluge of Ogyges, the mythological ruler of Boeotia. The region was originally occupied by the Minyans who were autochthonous or Proto-Greek speaking people.

The names Achaioi and Danaoi seem to be pre-Dorian belonging to the people who were overthrown. They were forced to the region that later bore the name Achaea after the Dorian invasion. In the 5th century BC, they were redefined as contemporary speakers of Aeolic Greek which was spoken mainly in Thessaly, Boeotia and Lesbos. There are many controversial theories on the origin of the Achaeans. According to one view, the Achaeans were one of the fair-headed tribes of upper Europe, who pressed down over the Alps during the early Iron age (1300 BC) to southern Europe. Another theory suggests that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans. These theories are rejected by other scholars who, based on linguistic criteria, suggest that the Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks. There is also the theory that there was an Achaean ethnos that migrated from Asia minor to lower Thessaly prior to 2000 BC. Some Hittite texts mention a nation lying to the west called Ahhiyava or Ahhiya.

The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash (or Weshesh) who may be Achaeans. They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters. Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root da:-: \"flow, river\", da:-nu: \"any moving liquid, drops\", da: navo \"people living by the river, Skyth. nomadic people (in Rigveda water-demons, fem.Da:nu primordial goddess), in Greek Danaoi, Egypt. Danuna\". It is also possible that the name Danaans is pre-Greek. A country Danaja with a city Mukana (propaply: Mycenea) is mentioned in inscriptions from Egypt from Amenophis III (1390-1352 BC), Thutmosis III (1437 BC)."},{"qas":[{"question":"What names are used that are typically from  a father and have usually added a suffix or prefix ?","id":"5730a045069b5314008321cf","answers":[{"text":"Greek surnames are most commonly patronymics","answer_start":123}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What letter of the alphabet do most of the last names the men of Greecs end with ?","id":"5730a045069b5314008321d0","answers":[{"text":"Greek male surnames end in -s, which is the common ending","answer_start":179}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What other beginnings of origination do some of the last names of the Greeks share ?","id":"5730a045069b5314008321d1","answers":[{"text":"many have Latin, Turkish and Italian origin.","answer_start":795}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does it mean to have the letters OU added to the ending of a males last name ?","id":"5730a045069b5314008321d2","answers":[{"text":"some end in -ou, indicating the genitive case of this proper noun for patronymic reasons.","answer_start":309}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"patronymics","answer_start":156}],"question":"What names are used that are typically from a mother and have usually added a suffix or prefix?","id":"5ad29f83d7d075001a429c7a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"-s","answer_start":206}],"question":"What letter of the alphabet do most of the last names the men of France end with?","id":"5ad29f83d7d075001a429c7b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Latin, Turkish and Italian origin","answer_start":805}],"question":"What other beginnings of origination do some of the last names of the French share?","id":"5ad29f83d7d075001a429c7c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"proper noun","answer_start":363}],"question":"What does it mean to have the letters OU added to the ending of a females last name?","id":"5ad29f83d7d075001a429c7d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Greek surnames were widely in use by the 9th century supplanting the ancient tradition of using the father\u2019s name, however Greek surnames are most commonly patronymics.

In its early history, as Rome successfully defended itself against foreign threats in central and then northern Italy, neighboring city-states sought the protection a Roman alliance would bring. As such, early republican Rome was not an \"empire\" or \"state\" in the modern sense, but an alliance of independent city-states (similar to the Greek hegemonies of the same period) with varying degrees of genuine independence (which itself changed over time) engaged in an alliance of mutual self-protection, but led by Rome. With some important exceptions, successful wars in early republican Rome generally led not to annexation or military occupation, but to the restoration of the way things were. But the defeated city would be weakened (sometimes with outright land concessions) and thus less able to resist Romanizing influences, such as Roman settlers seeking land or trade with the growing Roman confederacy. It was also less able to defend itself against its non-Roman enemies, which made attack by these enemies more likely.

Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire agreed to an alliance to conquer and divide Egypt. Fearing this increasingly unstable situation, several small Greek kingdoms sent delegations to Rome to seek an alliance. The delegation succeeded, even though prior Greek attempts to involve Rome in Greek affairs had been met with Roman apathy. Our primary source about these events, the surviving works of Polybius, do not state Rome's reason for getting involved. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum to cease his campaigns against Rome's new Greek allies. Doubting Rome's strength (a reasonable doubt, given Rome's performance in the First Macedonian War) Philip ignored the request, and Rome sent an army of Romans and Greek allies, beginning the Second Macedonian War. Despite his recent successes against the Greeks and earlier successes against Rome, Philip's army buckled under the pressure from the Roman-Greek army. In 197 BC, the Romans decisively defeated Philip at the Battle of Cynoscephalae, and Philip was forced to give up his recent Greek conquests.

The first is the foreign war, normally begun as a counter-offensive or defense of an ally. The second is the civil war, which plagued the Roman Republic in its final century. Roman armies were not invincible, despite their formidable reputation and host of victories. Over the centuries the Romans \"produced their share of incompetents\" who led Roman armies into catastrophic defeats.

By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state forestation programmes. Almost all land outside urban areas is farmland. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, wych elm, birch and pine. Beech and lime, though not native to Ireland, are also common there.

For example, the 2005\u201306 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team's players is known as a formation. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager."},{"qas":[{"question":"What decade is considered the \"golden age\" of women's football?","id":"57303e14947a6a140053d316","answers":[{"text":"1920s","answer_start":248}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Since what year has women's football been an Olympic event?","id":"57303e14947a6a140053d317","answers":[{"text":"1996","answer_start":690}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who voted to ban women's football from its grounds in 1921?","id":"57303e14947a6a140053d318","answers":[{"text":"England's Football Association","answer_start":339}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In 1971, who officially recognized women's football?","id":"57303e14947a6a140053d319","answers":[{"text":"UEFA","answer_start":480}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What year was the FIFA Women's first World cup?","id":"57303e14947a6a140053d31a","answers":[{"text":"1991","answer_start":588}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1920s","answer_start":248}],"question":"What decade is considered the \"golden age\" of men's football?","id":"5a79d8d417ab25001a8a00e2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1996","answer_start":690}],"question":"What year was women's football not an Olympic event?","id":"5a79d8d417ab25001a8a00e3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"England's Football Association","answer_start":339}],"question":"Who voted to ban women's football from its grounds in 1919?","id":"5a79d8d417ab25001a8a00e4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"UEFA","answer_start":480}],"question":"Who officially recognized women's football in 1970?","id":"5a79d8d417ab25001a8a00e5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1991","answer_start":588}],"question":"What year was the FIFA Women's last World cup?","id":"5a79d8d417ab25001a8a00e6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both national and international level mirroring the male competitions.

Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1\u20130 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90 minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken."}]},"388":{"title":"Georgian_architecture","paragraphs":[]},"389":{"title":"Liberia","paragraphs":[]},"390":{"title":"Alfred_North_Whitehead","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Who was frustrated in Whitehead's books but still interested?","id":"5730976a069b5314008321b9","answers":[{"text":"Mathews","answer_start":9}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What school recognized the importance of Whitehead's work?","id":"5730976a069b5314008321ba","answers":[{"text":"Chicago's Divinity School","answer_start":154}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who was invited to the Chicago Divinity school as one of Whitehead's only experts?","id":"5730976a069b5314008321bb","answers":[{"text":"Henry Nelson Wieman","answer_start":361}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was Henry Nelson Wieman invited to the Chicago Divinity school?","id":"5730976a069b5314008321bc","answers":[{"text":"1927","answer_start":301}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happened after Henry Nelson Wieman gave a lecture about Whitehead?","id":"5730976a069b5314008321bd","answers":[{"text":"hired","answer_start":499}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What affect did Matthews' opinion of the difficulty of Whitehead's works have on his interest in them?","id":"57333c754776f419006607b6","answers":[{"text":"Mathews' frustration with Whitehead's books did not negatively affect his interest","answer_start":9}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How did many philosophers and theologians at Chicago's Divinity School view Whitehead's work?","id":"57333c754776f419006607b7","answers":[{"text":"perceived the importance of what Whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications","answer_start":185}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What expert on Whitehead delivered a lecture at the school to explain Whitehead's ideas?","id":"57333c754776f419006607b8","answers":[{"text":"Henry Nelson Wieman","answer_start":361}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the result of that lecture?","id":"57333c754776f419006607b9","answers":[{"text":"Wieman's lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years","answer_start":444}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Mathews' frustration with Whitehead's books did not negatively affect his interest","answer_start":9}],"question":"What affect did Matthews' opinion of the ease of Whitehead's works have on his interest in them?","id":"5ad3cc25604f3c001a3ff13b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"perceived the importance of what Whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications","answer_start":185}],"question":"How did many philosophers and theologians at Illinois Divinity School view Whitehead's work?","id":"5ad3cc25604f3c001a3ff13c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Henry Nelson Wieman","answer_start":361}],"question":"What expert on Whitehead delivered a lecture at the school to reject Whitehead's ideas?","id":"5ad3cc25604f3c001a3ff13d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Mathews","answer_start":9}],"question":" Who was amused in Whitehead's books but still interested?","id":"5ad3cc25604f3c001a3ff13e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"However, Mathews' frustration with Whitehead's books did not negatively affect his interest.

Yutaka Tanaka, who suggests that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings, proposes that Einstein's work does not actually refute Whitehead's formulation. Whitehead's view has now been rendered obsolete, with the discovery of gravitational waves. They are phenonena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that Whitehead assumes. Consequently, Whitehead's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation, and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry, Minkowskian in particular, as an often-locally-adequate approximation.

Mice exposed to subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment (STAT)\u2013 with either penicillin, vancomycin, penicillin and vancomycin, or chlortetracycline had altered composition of the gut microbiota as well as its metabolic capabilities. Moreover, research have shown that mice given low-dose penicillin (1 \u03bcg\/g body weight) around birth and throughout the weaning process had an increased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and increased hepatic expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, compared to controlled mice. In addition, penicillin in combination with a high-fat diet increased fasting insulin levels in mice. However, it is unclear whether or not antibiotics cause obesity in humans. Studies have found a correlation between early exposure of antibiotics (<6 months) and increased body mass (at 10 and 20 months). Another study found that the type of antibiotic exposure was also significant with the highest risk of being overweight in those given macrolides compared to penicillin and cephalosporin. Therefore, there is correlation between antibiotic exposure in early life and obesity in humans, but whether or not there is a causal relationship remains unclear. Although there is a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and obesity, the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans needs to be weighed against the beneficial effects of clinically indicated treatment with antibiotics in infancy."},{"qas":[{"question":"What has been talked about to treat resistant bacteria?","id":"5733d6e64776f41900661328","answers":[{"text":"Phage therapy","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How have researchers been doing this?","id":"5733d6e64776f41900661329","answers":[{"text":"infecting pathogenic bacteria","answer_start":148}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is a worry of using phages?","id":"5733d6e64776f4190066132a","answers":[{"text":"phages will infect \"good\" bacteria","answer_start":801}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Phage therapy","answer_start":0}],"question":"What has been talked about to treat bateriophages?","id":"5a65ebb4c2b11c001a425df7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"infecting pathogenic bacteria","answer_start":148}],"question":"How have bacterium been doing this?","id":"5a65ebb4c2b11c001a425df8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"phages will infect \"good\" bacteria","answer_start":801}],"question":"What is a worry of using DNA?","id":"5a65ebb4c2b11c001a425df9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"studies have proven that phages are very specific","answer_start":923}],"question":"What makes researchers confident that phages fight pathogens?","id":"5a65ebb4c2b11c001a425dfa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium","answer_start":384}],"question":"By what method do phages destroy antibiotics?","id":"5a65ebb4c2b11c001a425dfb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Phage therapy is another option that is being looked into for treating resistant strains of bacteria. The way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, more specifically, bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles. By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium, phages destroy their metabolism, which eventually results in the cell's death. Phages will insert their DNA into the bacterium, allowing their DNA to be transcribed. Once their DNA is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released, the cell will lyse. One of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect \"good\" bacteria, or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings. However, studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria, which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria."}]},"392":{"title":"Windows_8","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Who equated windos 8 as the first desktop operating system that understand what a computer is supposed to do?","id":"57304f698ab72b1400f9c42e","answers":[{"text":"David Pierce","answer_start":372}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Why did Pierce give the Start Screen such glowing reviews?","id":"57304f698ab72b1400f9c42f","answers":[{"text":"because it allows users to interact with dynamic information","answer_start":804}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which improvements were most well regarded?","id":"57304f698ab72b1400f9c430","answers":[{"text":"File History, Storage Spaces, and the updated Task Manager","answer_start":1240}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who else uses a closed distribution platform?","id":"57304f698ab72b1400f9c431","answers":[{"text":"Apple","answer_start":1807}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"David Pierce","answer_start":372}],"question":"Who equated windows 9 as the first desktop operating system that understand what a computer is supposed to do?","id":"5ad49fe8ba00c4001a268e2e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"David Pierce","answer_start":372}],"question":"Who equated windows 8 as the last desktop operating system that understand what a computer is supposed to do?","id":"5ad49fe8ba00c4001a268e2f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"because it allows users to interact with dynamic information","answer_start":804}],"question":"Why did Pierce give the Start Screen such poor reviews?","id":"5ad49fe8ba00c4001a268e30","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"File History, Storage Spaces, and the updated Task Manager","answer_start":1240}],"question":"Which improvements were least well regarded?","id":"5ad49fe8ba00c4001a268e31","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Apple","answer_start":1807}],"question":"Who else uses an open distribution platform?","id":"5ad49fe8ba00c4001a268e32","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Reviews of the various editions of Windows 8 have been mixed.

David Pierce of The Verge described Windows 8 as \"the first desktop operating system that understands what a computer is supposed to do in 2012\" and praised Microsoft's \"no compromise\" approach and the operating system's emphasis on Internet connectivity and cloud services. Pierce also considered the Start Screen to be a \"brilliant innovation for desktop computers\" when compared with \"folder-littered desktops on every other OS\" because it allows users to interact with dynamic information. In contrast, an ExtremeTech article said it was Microsoft \"flailing\" and a review in PC Magazine condemned the Metro-style user interface. Some of the included apps in Windows 8 were considered to be basic and lacking in functionality, but the Xbox apps were praised for their promotion of a multi-platform entertainment experience. Other improvements and features (such as File History, Storage Spaces, and the updated Task Manager) were also regarded as positive changes. Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote that while its user interface changes may overshadow them, Windows 8's improved performance, updated file manager, new storage functionality, expanded security features, and updated Task Manager were still positive improvements for the operating system. Bright also said that Windows 8's duality towards tablets and traditional PCs was an \"extremely ambitious\" aspect of the platform as well, but criticized Microsoft for emulating Apple's model of a closed distribution platform when implementing the Windows Store."},{"qas":[{"question":"What makes the Windows 8 interface difficult to use?","id":"573051012461fd1900a9cd17","answers":[{"text":"the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface","answer_start":157}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who said the Windows 8 interface was clumsy and impractical?","id":"573051012461fd1900a9cd18","answers":[{"text":"Adrian Kingsley-Hughes","answer_start":1112}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kind of feedback has Windows 8 received?","id":"573051012461fd1900a9cd19","answers":[{"text":"mixed","answer_start":51}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface","answer_start":161}],"question":"What makes the Windows 9 interface difficult to use?","id":"5ad4a032ba00c4001a268e38","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface","answer_start":161}],"question":"What makes the Windows 8 interface easy to use?","id":"5ad4a032ba00c4001a268e39","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Adrian Kingsley-Hughes","answer_start":1112}],"question":"Who said the Windows 9 interface was clumsy and impractical?","id":"5ad4a032ba00c4001a268e3a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Adrian Kingsley-Hughes","answer_start":1112}],"question":"Who said the Windows 8 interface was practical?","id":"5ad4a032ba00c4001a268e3b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"mixed","answer_start":51}],"question":"What kind of feedback has Windows 9 received?","id":"5ad4a032ba00c4001a268e3c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction.

Despite this \"stumbling block\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \"Metro\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \"as stunning as it is surprising\", contributing to an \"incredibly personal\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \"clumsy and impractical\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\"), and concluded that \"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction\u2014touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.\""},{"qas":[{"question":"What does CCTV stand for?","id":"573056f1069b531400832085","answers":[{"text":"China Central Television","answer_start":32}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of the Chinese social network?","id":"573056f1069b531400832086","answers":[{"text":"Sina Weibo","answer_start":875}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who claimed that the Window 8 OS could gather sensitive user information?","id":"573056f1069b531400832087","answers":[{"text":"Ni Guangnan","answer_start":191}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where did Yang Min practice as a computer scientiest?","id":"573056f1069b531400832088","answers":[{"text":"Fudan University","answer_start":557}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"China Central Television","answer_start":32}],"question":"What doesn't CCTV stand for?","id":"5ad4a204ba00c4001a268e88","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"China Central Television","answer_start":32}],"question":"What does CTCV stand for?","id":"5ad4a204ba00c4001a268e89","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Sina Weibo","answer_start":875}],"question":"What isn't the name of the Chinese social network?","id":"5ad4a204ba00c4001a268e8a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Ni Guangnan","answer_start":191}],"question":"Who claimed that the Window 9 OS could gather sensitive user information?","id":"5ad4a204ba00c4001a268e8b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Fudan University","answer_start":557}],"question":"Where didn't Yang Min practice as a computer scientest?","id":"5ad4a204ba00c4001a268e8c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In June 2014, state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) broadcast a news story further characterizing Windows 8 as a threat to national security.

Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport, often before they even take off from their departure point. Large airports have a frequency called Clearance Delivery which is used by departing aircraft specifically for this purpose. This then allows aircraft to take the most direct approach path to the runway and land without worrying about interference from other aircraft. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air."},{"qas":[{"question":"What pulls the aircraft to one of the airbridges?","id":"57309634069b5314008321af","answers":[{"text":"tow tractor","answer_start":56}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What keeps the electricity running in the plane when it stands at the terminal?","id":"57309634069b5314008321b0","answers":[{"text":"ground power unit","answer_start":117}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The passengers disembark using what?","id":"57309634069b5314008321b1","answers":[{"text":"airbridge","answer_start":362}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What can give the ground crew more clearance after the aircraft lands?","id":"57309634069b5314008321b2","answers":[{"text":"Mobile stairs","answer_start":373}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How long should it take for an aircraft to be off the airport and in the air?","id":"57309634069b5314008321b3","answers":[{"text":"90 minutes","answer_start":1645}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the electricity","answer_start":288}],"question":"What do engines generate when planes are standing at the terminal?","id":"5a4ea64baf0d07001ae8cb94","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the airbridge","answer_start":358}],"question":"Where do the ground crew disembark from?","id":"5a4ea64baf0d07001ae8cb95","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the awkwardly shaped, or late luggage","answer_start":1397}],"question":"What does the ground crew use the skybridge to bring in after its pushed on one of the tractor dollies?","id":"5a4ea64baf0d07001ae8cb96","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"tow tractor","answer_start":56}],"question":"What pulls an airbridge to the aircraft?","id":"5a4ea64baf0d07001ae8cb97","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"in 90 minutes","answer_start":1642}],"question":"When should the ground crew be done removing luggage?","id":"5a4ea64baf0d07001ae8cb98","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Many ground crew at the airport work at the aircraft.

Attempts to address this question instead rely on archaeological evidence, the accounts of foreign observers, legends and literature from centuries later. To some extent the controversy is related to the foundation myths of modern states in the region. According to the \"Normanist\" view, the Rus' were Scandinavians, while Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the Rus' were themselves Slavs. Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the East Slavs, the Russian Primary Chronicle, although even this account was not produced until the 12th century. Nationalist accounts have suggested that the Rus' were present before the arrival of the Varangians, noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in modern Russian and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a Scandinavian population was present during the 10th century at the latest. On balance, it seems likely that the Rus' proper were a small minority of Scandinavians who formed an elite ruling class, while the great majority of their subjects were Slavs. Considering the linguistic arguments mounted by nationalist scholars, if the proto-Rus' were Scandinavians, they must have quickly become nativized, adopting Slavic languages and other cultural practices."},{"qas":[{"question":"What known document tells of the death of Oleg?","id":"57311c1005b4da19006bcda8","answers":[{"text":"The Chronicle","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was prophesised by a sorcerer involving Oleg's death?","id":"57311c1005b4da19006bcda9","answers":[{"text":"certain horse","answer_start":138}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does Oleg do to his horse?","id":"57311c1005b4da19006bcdaa","answers":[{"text":"has the horse sequestered","answer_start":158}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"WHo succeeded Oleg in 913?","id":"57311c1005b4da19006bcdab","answers":[{"text":"Prince Igor","answer_start":412}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Chronicle","answer_start":0}],"question":"What known document tells the birth of Oleg?","id":"5ad00aa277cf76001a6867ea","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"913","answer_start":442}],"question":"What year did Oleg die?","id":"5ad00aa277cf76001a6867eb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Prince Igor","answer_start":412}],"question":"Who conquered and killed Oleg?","id":"5ad00aa277cf76001a6867ec","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Oleg","answer_start":434}],"question":"Who dies in the 913?","id":"5ad00aa277cf76001a6867ed","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The Chronicle provides a mythic tale of Oleg's death.

Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \"prepurified\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \"Conception of St. Ann [i.e., of the Theotokos in her womb]\" was becoming popular. After this period, the \"purification\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius)."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where did the majority of the concepts of Mary's birth show themselves the most ?","id":"5730ca8fb7151e1900c01536","answers":[{"text":"Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians","answer_start":25}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What Byzantine Ruler ho ruled from from 527 to 565 was also a well trained thinker of concepts ?","id":"5730ca8fb7151e1900c01537","answers":[{"text":"Emperor Justinian I,","answer_start":305}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In what way did this Ruler refer to Mary  in his writings ?","id":"5730ca8fb7151e1900c01538","answers":[{"text":"to call Mary \"prepurified\"","answer_start":342}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What event happened to Theotokos that was of significant religious note ?","id":"5730ca8fb7151e1900c01539","answers":[{"text":"she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation","answer_start":605}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How did some view the the person whose name includes a Christian rite of passage from the Bible?

Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749\/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ, especially in the legacy of Nazianzen. As such, Nazianzen's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary's holiness to also imitate Christ's baptism at the Jordan. The Damascene's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary's \"pre purification\" as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature. In fact, Damascene (along with Nazianzen) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary's complete holiness from her Conception by the \"all pure seed\" of Joachim and the womb \"wider than heaven\" of St. Ann."},{"qas":[{"question":"Who began to query the position of the conception of Mary following the 11th century ?","id":"5730ef4105b4da19006bcc60","answers":[{"text":"St Bernard of Clairvaux","answer_start":22}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who did the query starter lay blame upon for the festivals that surrounded Mary's inception ?","id":"5730ef4205b4da19006bcc61","answers":[{"text":"St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of Lyon for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See.","answer_start":246}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did the query starter believe to be the ultimate difficulty in accepting  the a virgin conception of Mary ?","id":"5730ef4205b4da19006bcc62","answers":[{"text":"How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence (libido)?","answer_start":762}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did the query starter believe had been done by Mary's direct  maternal line that contradict the conception theory of immaculate for Mary ?","id":"5730ef4205b4da19006bcc63","answers":[{"text":"conception in the active sense of the mother's cooperation","answer_start":672}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Did the query starter believe that the festival for Mary's conception had authorization to be held ?","id":"5730ef4205b4da19006bcc64","answers":[{"text":"instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See","answer_start":314}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"St Bernard of Clairvaux","answer_start":22}],"question":"Who raised the question of the Immaculate Conception in the 1200s?","id":"5a273563c93d92001a400425","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin","answer_start":133}],"question":"What was already being celebrated in some churches of the East?","id":"5a273563c93d92001a400426","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"church of Lyon","answer_start":295}],"question":"Who instituted a feast of the conception of the Blessed Virgin with the permission of the Holy See?","id":"5a273563c93d92001a400427","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Mary","answer_start":469}],"question":"Whose conception does St. Bernard say was sinless?","id":"5a273563c93d92001a400428","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Pope Pius IX","answer_start":614}],"question":"What Pope's definition of conception agreed with St. Bernard's?","id":"5a273563c93d92001a400429","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"It seems to have been St Bernard of Clairvaux who, in the 12th century, explicitly raised the question of the Immaculate Conception.

The most famous Eastern Orthodox theologian to imply Mary's Immaculate Conception was St. Gregory Palamas. Though many passages from his works were long known to extol and attribute to Mary a Christlike holiness in her human nature, traditional objections to Palamas' disposition toward the Immaculate Conception typically rely on a poor understanding of his doctrine of \"the purification of Mary\" at the Annunciation. Not only did he explicitly cite St. Gregory Nazianzen for his understanding of Jesus' purification at His baptism and Mary's at the Annunciation, but Theophanes of Nicaea, Joseph Bryennius, and Gennadios Scholarios all explicitly placed Mary's Conception as the first moment of her all-immaculate participation in the divine energies to such a degree that she was always completely without spot and graced. In addition to Emperor Manuel II and Gennadius Scholarius, St. Mark of Ephesus also fervently defended Mary's title as \"prepurified\" against the Dominican, Manuel Calecas, who was perhaps promoting thomistic Mariology that denied Mary's all-holiness from the first moment of her existence."},{"qas":[{"question":"Does everyone agree on the credit that should be given for the story of Mary's inception ?","id":"5731070b05b4da19006bcce4","answers":[{"text":"Others have rejected that the doctrine of Immaculate Conception exists in Islam","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does the book of Muslim faith state in regards to how every person is born ?","id":"5731070b05b4da19006bcce5","answers":[{"text":"in Islam every human child is born pure and immaculate","answer_start":168}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Does this view contradict the belief that Mary was also born to a virgin mother ?","id":"5731070b05b4da19006bcce6","answers":[{"text":"her sinless birth is thus independent of the Christian docrtrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in Islam","answer_start":224}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What view did the Qua-ran take on the sinful ways in which Mary could have been conceived ?","id":"5731070b05b4da19006bcce7","answers":[{"text":"Muslim tradition or hadith, which states that the only children born without the \"touch of Satan,\" were Mary and Jesus.","answer_start":557}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of the prayer that is listed in the Qua-ran  is used to enact a safeguard on kids from the  the devil ?","id":"5731070b05b4da19006bcce8","answers":[{"text":"Hannah's prayer in the Quran for her child to remain protected from Satan","answer_start":352}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"every human child is born pure and immaculate","answer_start":177}],"question":"How does the Qur\\an confirm the Immaculat Conception of Mary?","id":"5a2760d5d1a287001a6d0a3c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"her sinless birth","answer_start":224}],"question":"What does the Qur'an say is dependent on Christian doctrine?","id":"5a2760d5d1a287001a6d0a3d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"after it had already been born","answer_start":445}],"question":"When did Mary pray for her child to remain protected from Satan?","id":"5a2760d5d1a287001a6d0a3e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Muslim tradition or hadith","answer_start":553}],"question":"What exonerates Mary and Jesus?","id":"5a2760d5d1a287001a6d0a3f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Mary and Jesus","answer_start":924}],"question":"Who does the hadith refer to as servents?","id":"5a2760d5d1a287001a6d0a40","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Others have rejected that the doctrine of Immaculate Conception exists in Islam, the Quranic account does not confirm the Immaculate Conception exclusively for Mary as in Islam every human child is born pure and immaculate, her sinless birth is thus independent of the Christian docrtrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in Islam.

The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration."},{"qas":[{"question":"Why are birds' arteries composed of thick elastic muscles?","id":"573123ff05b4da19006bcdec","answers":[{"text":"to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction","answer_start":302}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What moves through the arteries?","id":"573123ff05b4da19006bcded","answers":[{"text":"Blood","answer_start":417}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is organized into capillary beds in tissues?","id":"573123ff05b4da19006bcdee","answers":[{"text":"Capillaries","answer_start":870}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the funneling that occurs that brings blood back to the heart?","id":"573123ff05b4da19006bcdef","answers":[{"text":"vasodilation","answer_start":1361}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which bird system is large relative to a bird's size?","id":"573124bb497a881900248bb5","answers":[{"text":"nervous system","answer_start":4}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is tetrachromatic?","id":"573124bb497a881900248bb6","answers":[{"text":"possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones","answer_start":596}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Why do birds need to perceive ultraviolet light?","id":"573124bb497a881900248bb7","answers":[{"text":"courtship","answer_start":762}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What regulates breeding activities?","id":"573124bb497a881900248bb8","answers":[{"text":"photo-receptive cells in","answer_start":915}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"The nervous system is large relative to the bird's size.

Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators.

Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism.

Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry. This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily.

For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.\" Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore it in the form of a top-knot. The order triggered strong resistance to Qing rule in Jiangnan and massive killing of ethnic Han Chinese.

Li Chengdong, a Han Chinese general who had served the Ming but surrendered to the Qing, ordered his Han troops to carry out three separate massacres in the city of Jiading within a month, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths.

At the peak of the rebels' fortunes, they extended their control as far north as the Yangtze River, nearly establishing a divided China. Wu then hesitated to go further north, not being able to coordinate strategy with his allies, and Kangxi was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu generals. By 1681, the Qing government had established control over a ravaged southern China which took several decades to recover. Manchu Generals and Bannermen were initially put to shame by the better performance of the Han Chinese Green Standard Army, who fought better than them against the rebels and this was noted by Kangxi, leading him to task Generals Sun Sike, Wang Jinbao, and Zhao Liangdong to lead Green Standard Soldiers to crush the rebels. The Qing thought that Han Chinese were superior at battling other Han people and so used the Green Standard Army as the dominant and majority army in crushing the rebels instead of Bannermen. Similarly, in northwestern China against Wang Fuchen, the Qing used Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers and Han Chinese Generals such as Zhang Liangdong, Wang Jinbao, and Zhang Yong as the primary military forces. This choice was due to the rocky terrain, which favoured infantry troops over cavalry, to the desire to keep Bannermen in the reserves, and, again, to the belief that Han troops were better at fighting other Han people. These Han generals achieved victory over the rebels. Also due to the mountainous terrain, Sichuan and southern Shaanxi were also retaken by the Han Chinese Green Standard Army under Wang Jinbao and Zhao Liangdong in 1680, with Manchus only participating in dealing with logistics and provisions. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers and 150,000 Bannermen served on the Qing side during the war. 213 Han Chinese Banner companies, and 527 companies of Mongol and Manchu Banners were mobilized by the Qing during the revolt. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers were used against the Three Feudatories besides 200,000 Bannermen."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where did Kangxi lead an army?","id":"57313a17497a881900248c8f","answers":[{"text":"Outer Mongolia","answer_start":154}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who did Kangxi fight?","id":"57313a17497a881900248c90","answers":[{"text":"Dzungars","answer_start":142}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was Galdan killed?","id":"57313a17497a881900248c91","answers":[{"text":"Dzungar\u2013Qing War","answer_start":347}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did Taiwan fall?","id":"57313a17497a881900248c92","answers":[{"text":"1683","answer_start":368}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What European country did Kangxi fight?","id":"57313a17497a881900248c93","answers":[{"text":"Russia","answer_start":1206}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"To extend and consolidate the dynasty's control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia.

In fact, his father had trusted him with delicate political issues and discussed state policy with him.

He expanded his father's system of Palace Memorials which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy, and created a small Grand Council of personal advisors which eventually grew into the emperor's de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty. He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage. When he began to realize that the financial crisis was even greater than he had thought, Yongzheng rejected his father's lenient approach to local landowning elites and mounted a campaign to enforce collection of the land tax. The increased revenues were to be used for \"money to nourish honesty\" among local officials and for local irrigation, schools, roads, and charity. Although these reforms were effective in the north, in the south and lower Yangzi valley, where Kangxi had wooed the elites, there were long established networks of officials and landowners. Yongzheng dispatched experienced Manchu commissioners to penetrate the thickets of falsified land registers and coded account books, but they were met with tricks, passivity, and even violence.

Only Manchus belonging to the Upper Three Banners, and selected Han Chinese who had passed the highest level of martial exams could serve as the emperor's personal bodyguards. The remaining Banners were known as the \"Lower Five Banners.\" They were commanded by hereditary Manchu princes descended from Nurhachi's immediate family, known informally as the \"Iron cap princes\". Together they formed the ruling council of the Manchu nation as well as high command of the army. Nurhachi's son Hong Taiji expanded the system to include mirrored Mongol and Han Banners. After capturing Beijing in 1644, the relatively small Banner armies were further augmented by the Green Standard Army, made up of those Ming troops who had surrendered to the Qing, which eventually outnumbered Banner troops three to one.

The years leading up to the conquest increased the number of Han Chinese under Manchu rule, leading Hong Taiji to create the Eight Han Banners (zh), and around the time of the Qing takeover of Beijing, their numbers rapidly swelled. Han Bannermen held high status and power in the early Qing period, especially immediately after the conquest during Shunzhi and Kangxi's reign where they dominated Governor-Generalships and Governorships across China at the expense of both Manchu Bannermen and Han civilians. Han also numerically dominated the Banners up until the mid 18th century. European visitors in Beijing called them \"Tartarized Chinese\" or \"Tartarified Chinese\". It was in Qianlong's reign that the Qianlong Emperor, concerned about maintaining Manchu identity, re-emphasized Manchu ethnicity, ancestry, language, and culture in the Eight Banners and started a mass discharge of Han Bannermen from the Eight Banners, either asking them to voluntarily resign from the Banner rolls or striking their names off. This led to a change from Han majority to a Manchu majority within the Banner system, and previous Han Bannermen garrisons in southern China such as at Fuzhou, Zhenjiang, Guangzhou, were replaced by Manchu Bannermen in the purge, which started in 1754. The turnover by Qianlong most heavily impacted Han banner garrisons stationed in the provinces while it less impacted Han Bannermen in Beijing, leaving a larger proportion of remaining Han Bannermen in Beijing than the provinces. Han Bannermen's status was decreased from that point on with Manchu Banners gaining higher status. Han Bannermen numbered 75% in 1648 Shunzhi's reign, 72% in 1723 Yongzheng's reign, but decreased to 43% in 1796 during the first year of Jiaqing's reign, which was after Qianlong's purge. The mass discharge was known as the Disbandment of the Han Banners (zh). Qianlong directed most of his ire at those Han Bannermen descended from defectors who joined the Qing after the Qing passed through the Great Wall at Shanhai Pass in 1644, deeming their ancestors as traitors to the Ming and therefore untrustworthy, while retaining Han Bannermen who were descended from defectors who joined the Qing before 1644 in Liaodong and marched through Shanhai pass, also known as those who \"followed the Dragon through the pass\" (\u5f9e\u9f8d\u5165\u95dc; cong long ru guan)."}]},"408":{"title":"Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What characteristic did the majority of Native American music have?","id":"5731752de6313a140071cf56","answers":[{"text":"monophonic","answer_start":58}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did traditional Native American music center around?","id":"5731752de6313a140071cf57","answers":[{"text":"drumming","answer_start":159}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are examples of popular percussive instruments of Native Americans?","id":"5731752de6313a140071cf58","answers":[{"text":"Rattles, clappersticks, and rasps","answer_start":169}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How were flutes constructed by the Native Americans?","id":"5731752de6313a140071cf59","answers":[{"text":"rivercane, cedar, and other woods","answer_start":265}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many strings did the Apache fiddle have?","id":"5731752de6313a140071cf5a","answers":[{"text":"single","answer_start":630}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"Native American music in North America is almost entirely monophonic, but there are notable exceptions.

In fact, more than 80% of the European scientists between 1450\u20131650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained, of which approximately 45% held university posts. It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction. Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change. There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities. Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources."}]},"413":{"title":"Religion_in_ancient_Rome","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What did the Romans tend to do with local religions and deities in conquered areas?

One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods. By the height of the Empire, numerous international deities were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote provinces, among them Cybele, Isis, Epona, and gods of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing monotheistic systems. The monotheistic rigor of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict. For example, religious disputes helped cause the First Jewish\u2013Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt."},{"qas":[{"question":"What did obscure festivals offer Romans the opportunity to do?","id":"5731ab21b9d445190005e44d","answers":[{"text":"reinterpretation","answer_start":169}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did Augustus wish to do for Roman religion?","id":"5731ab21b9d445190005e44e","answers":[{"text":"reform","answer_start":248}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What poet wrote a long poem describing Roman religious holidays?","id":"5731ab21b9d445190005e44f","answers":[{"text":"Ovid","answer_start":346}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was lacking in the presentation of religious events in Rome?","id":"5731ab21b9d445190005e450","answers":[{"text":"authoritative calendar","answer_start":1207}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Under whose rule were new Christian festivals added to previous Roman holidays?","id":"5731ab21b9d445190005e451","answers":[{"text":"Christian","answer_start":1281}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"The meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome's intellectual elite, but the more obscure they were, the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation \u2014 a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform, which often cloaked autocratic innovation, nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era, Ovid. In his Fasti, a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June, Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore, popular customs, and religious practice that is by turns imaginative, entertaining, high-minded, and scurrilous; not a priestly account, despite the speaker's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet, but a work of description, imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia, Consualia, and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March, where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people. But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events, indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances.

Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space; its ancient boundary (pomerium) had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state. In Rome, the central references for the establishment of an augural templum appear to have been the Via Sacra (Sacred Way) and the pomerium. Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur, who read the divine will through observations made within the templum before, during and after an act of sacrifice. Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice, errant rites (vitium) or an unacceptable plan of action. If an unfavourable sign was given, the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen, consult with his augural colleagues, or abandon the project. Magistrates could use their right of augury (ius augurum) to adjourn and overturn the process of law, but were obliged to base their decision on the augur's observations and advice. For Cicero, himself an augur, this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic. By his time (mid 1st century BC) augury was supervised by the college of pontifices, whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the cursus honorum."},{"qas":[{"question":"What type of rites varied in accordance with status and religion?","id":"5731ea07b9d445190005e679","answers":[{"text":"Funeral and commemorative","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the grave sacrifice in Cicero's time?","id":"5731ea07b9d445190005e67a","answers":[{"text":"sow","answer_start":136}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What class gave only wine and food as a grave offering?","id":"5731ea07b9d445190005e67b","answers":[{"text":"less well-off","answer_start":340}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the multi day of remembrance for the dead?

Before the battle, Decius is granted a prescient dream that reveals his fate. When he offers sacrifice, the victim's liver appears \"damaged where it refers to his own fortunes\". Otherwise, the haruspex tells him, the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods. In a prayer recorded by Livy, Decius commits himself and the enemy to the dii Manes and Tellus, charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks, and is killed; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering.

He calls this approach the \"genius of religious sentiment in the United States.\""}]},"416":{"title":"Protestantism","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What does the word Anabaptist describe?","id":"5731e35d0fdd8d15006c660f","answers":[{"text":"one who baptizes again","answer_start":30}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who named the Anabaptists?","id":"5731e35d0fdd8d15006c6610","answers":[{"text":"their persecutors","answer_start":73}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What baptism do Anabaptists reject?","id":"5731e35d0fdd8d15006c6611","answers":[{"text":"baptism of infants","answer_start":297}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who persecuted the Anabaptists in the 16th century?","id":"5731e35d0fdd8d15006c6612","answers":[{"text":"Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics","answer_start":701}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Hans Denck was considered what type of reformer?","id":"5731e35d0fdd8d15006c6613","answers":[{"text":"Second Front Reformers","answer_start":1404}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"The name Anabaptist, meaning \"one who baptizes again\", was given them by their persecutors in reference to the practice of re-baptizing converts who already had been baptized as infants. Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates be able to make their own confessions of faith and so rejected baptism of infants. The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist, claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and void, the baptizing of believers was not a re-baptism but in fact their first real baptism. As a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues, Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics.[aa] While most Anabaptists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount, which precluded taking oaths, participating in military actions, and participating in civil government, some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise.[ab] They were thus technically Anabaptists, even though conservative Amish, Mennonites, and Hutterites and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism. Anabaptist reformers of the Radical Reformation are diveded into Radical and the so-called Second Front. Some important Radical Reformation theologians were John of Leiden, Thomas M\u00fcntzer, Kaspar Schwenkfeld, Sebastian Franck, Menno Simons.

In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called \"kef\" style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified\/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated. Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional \"kef\" style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of \"kef music\" heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia. Also with artists such as Sirusho, performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry. Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour, pianist Sahan Arzruni, prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan. Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down (which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs) or pop star Cher. Ruben Hakobyan (Ruben Sasuntsi) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent. In the Armenian diaspora, Armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth.[citation needed] These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes."}]},"421":{"title":"Jehovah%27s_Witnesses","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What are the Jehovah Witnesses?","id":"57323b8ae17f3d1400422751","answers":[{"text":"millenarian restorationist Christian denomination","answer_start":25}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are the beliefs of Jehovah Witnesses distinct from?","id":"57323b8ae17f3d1400422752","answers":[{"text":"mainstream Christianity","answer_start":117}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many adherents worldwide does the group claim?","id":"57323b8ae17f3d1400422753","answers":[{"text":"more than 8.2 million","answer_start":185}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who is in charges of directing the Jehovah Witnesses?","id":"57323b8ae17f3d1400422754","answers":[{"text":"Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses","answer_start":397}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where are the group elders located?","id":"57323b8ae17f3d1400422755","answers":[{"text":"Brooklyn, New York","answer_start":457}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"8.2 million","answer_start":195}],"question":"How many Jehovah Witnesses adherents live in the United States?","id":"5ad3ad1a604f3c001a3febdd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Brooklyn, New York","answer_start":457}],"question":"Where was Jehovah Witnesses founded?","id":"5ad3ad1a604f3c001a3febde","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"8.2 million","answer_start":195}],"question":"How many Jehovah Witnesses are involved in evangelism in the United States?","id":"5ad3ad1a604f3c001a3febdf","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Brooklyn, New York","answer_start":457}],"question":"Where do Jehovah Witnesses believe Armageddon will get its start?","id":"5ad3ad1a604f3c001a3febe0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Jehovah's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity.

Nevertheless, philosopher Kate Soper notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals, anti-humanism thus frequently \"secretes a humanist rhetoric\"."},{"qas":[{"question":"What writing was considered a bridge between two other major writings?","id":"5732a574cc179a14009dabcc","answers":[{"text":"The Age of Reason","answer_start":26}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which century was the first writing from?","id":"5732a574cc179a14009dabcd","answers":[{"text":"18th-century","answer_start":181}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who states imply that humans are their own Gods?","id":"5732a574cc179a14009dabce","answers":[{"text":"Feuerbach","answer_start":898}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the origin of the second writing?","id":"5732a574cc179a14009dabcf","answers":[{"text":"German","answer_start":477}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Age of Reason","answer_start":26}],"question":"What writing was considered a barrier between two other major writings?","id":"5a82070631013a001a33510b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"18th-century","answer_start":181}],"question":"Which century was the only writing from?","id":"5a82070631013a001a33510c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"German","answer_start":477}],"question":"What was the enemy of the second writing?","id":"5a82070631013a001a33510d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Feuerbach","answer_start":898}],"question":"Who disagreed with the statement \"Homo homini deus est\"?","id":"5a82070631013a001a33510e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Davies identifies Paine's The Age of Reason as \"the link between the two major narratives of what Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard calls the narrative of legitimation\": the rationalism of the 18th-century Philosophes and the radical, historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the Hegelians David Friedrich Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach. \"The first is political, largely French in inspiration, and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty'.

A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external witnesses (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide. Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses.

These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis. Koch's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture. Often, even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria. For example, Treponema pallidum, the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes. It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture. Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic)."},{"qas":[{"question":"When does infection begin?","id":"57341d3f4776f419006618a9","answers":[{"text":"when an organism successfully enters the body, grows and multiplies.","answer_start":17}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What group is not easily infected?","id":"57341d3f4776f419006618aa","answers":[{"text":"humans","answer_start":128}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What group of humans have increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections?","id":"57341d3f4776f419006618ab","answers":[{"text":"weak, sick, malnourished, have cancer or are diabetic","answer_start":174}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What individuals are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections?","id":"57341d3f4776f419006618ac","answers":[{"text":"Individuals who have a suppressed immune system","answer_start":295}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is it called when a pathogen grows within the host cells?","id":"57341d3f4776f419006618ad","answers":[{"text":"intracellular","answer_start":762}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"when an organism successfully enters the body, grows and multiplies","answer_start":17}],"question":"When does infection become unstoppable?","id":"5a82f6e9e60761001a2eb263","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"humans","answer_start":128}],"question":"What group is never infected?","id":"5a82f6e9e60761001a2eb264","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"weak, sick, malnourished, have cancer or are diabetic","answer_start":174}],"question":"What group of humans have no susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections?","id":"5a82f6e9e60761001a2eb265","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Individuals who have a suppressed immune system","answer_start":295}],"question":"What individuals are particularly safe to opportunistic infections?","id":"5a82f6e9e60761001a2eb266","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"intracellular","answer_start":762}],"question":"What is it called when a pathogen explodes within the host cells?","id":"5a82f6e9e60761001a2eb267","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Infection begins when an organism successfully enters the body, grows and multiplies.

Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness. The human strains of Ebola virus, for example, incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after. As a result, the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone. Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging. As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area. In contrast, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system. As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease. Also, the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances, increasing the likelihood of an epidemic."}]},"438":{"title":"Hunting","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kind of occupation do Hindu scriptures describe hunting as being?","id":"57344a29879d6814001ca4a1","answers":[{"text":"acceptable","answer_start":40}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is one of the names of the god Shiva?","id":"57344a29879d6814001ca4a2","answers":[{"text":"Mrigavyadha","answer_start":206}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the translation of Mrigavyadha?","id":"57344a29879d6814001ca4a3","answers":[{"text":"\"the deer hunter\"","answer_start":239}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does Shiva destroy in human beings?","id":"57344a29879d6814001ca4a4","answers":[{"text":"animal instincts","answer_start":496}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What talent does Dasharatha have?","id":"57344a29879d6814001ca4a5","answers":[{"text":"hunt in the dark","answer_start":615}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What scriptures describe hunting as and acceptable occupation?","id":"5735f8bc012e2f140011a106","answers":[{"text":"Hindu","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Godly figures have engaged in what activity?","id":"5735f8bc012e2f140011a107","answers":[{"text":"hunting","answer_start":160}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Mrigavyadha means what?","id":"5735f8bc012e2f140011a108","answers":[{"text":"deer hunter","answer_start":244}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Mrigavyadha destroys animal instinct in who?","id":"5735f8bc012e2f140011a109","answers":[{"text":"human beings","answer_start":516}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happened after Krishna was accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter?","id":"5735f8bc012e2f140011a10a","answers":[{"text":"died","answer_start":1089}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"by an arrow of a hunter","answer_start":1127}],"question":"How was Shiva accidentally wounded to later die?","id":"5ace5cb432bba1001ae4a3f9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"animal instincts","answer_start":496}],"question":"What does Ramayana destroy in animals?","id":"5ace5cb432bba1001ae4a3fa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"in the dark","answer_start":620}],"question":"How is Krishna said to be able to hunt?","id":"5ace5cb432bba1001ae4a3fb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Shravana","answer_start":695}],"question":"Who did Krishna mistake for game and accidentally kill?","id":"5ace5cb432bba1001ae4a3fc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the forest","answer_start":752}],"question":"Where was Krishna exiled to?","id":"5ace5cb432bba1001ae4a3fd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation, as well as a sport of the kingly.

Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided by the use of hounds, with the illegal use of trap guns, trap cages and snare nets. With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months - October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species (red-rumped agouti, lowland paca, nine-banded armadillo, collared peccary, and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013). It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the green iguana, the gold tegu, the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys, southern tamanduas, Brazilian porcupines, yellow-footed tortoises, Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds, the scarlet ibis. Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training. There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded, and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting occurring both in and out of season, and even in wildlife sanctuaries. There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments, and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management."}]},"439":{"title":"Kathmandu","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"When was the Pashupatinath Temple built?","id":"5735bb89e853931400426af7","answers":[{"text":"5th century","answer_start":37}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What faith does the Pashupatinath Temple serve?","id":"5735bb89e853931400426af8","answers":[{"text":"Hindu","answer_start":49}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is another name for Pashupati?","id":"5735bb89e853931400426af9","answers":[{"text":"Lord Shiva","answer_start":75}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Prior to the secularization of Nepal, who was the country's national god?","id":"5735bb89e853931400426afa","answers":[{"text":"Lord Pashupatinath","answer_start":278}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who damaged the Pashupatinath Temple in the 14th century?","id":"5735bb89e853931400426afb","answers":[{"text":"Mughal invaders","answer_start":386}],"is_impossible":false}],"context":"The Pashupatinath Temple is a famous 5th century Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva (Pashupati).
