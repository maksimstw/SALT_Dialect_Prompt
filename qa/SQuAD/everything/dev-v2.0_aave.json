Geneva was John Calvin adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would done had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss.

The result the multiple expansion engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations was used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free turbine engine.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"Along with poppet valve gears, what type of gears utilized separate admission and exhaust valves to give ideal events?","id":"571136b8a58dae1900cd6d22","answers":[{"text":"Corliss","answer_start":848},{"text":"patent valve","answer_start":84},{"text":"Corliss","answer_start":848}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Along with Stephenson and Walschaerts, what an example of a simple motion?","id":"571136b8a58dae1900cd6d23","answers":[{"text":"Joy","answer_start":819},{"text":"Joy","answer_start":819},{"text":"Joy","answer_start":819}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How is lap provided by overlapping the admission side port?","id":"571136b8a58dae1900cd6d24","answers":[{"text":"lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve","answer_start":460},{"text":"lengthening rubbing surfaces","answer_start":460},{"text":"lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve","answer_start":460}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Corliss","answer_start":849}],"question":"What type of gears, along with poppet valve gears, utilized separate admission and leakage cutoffs to give ideal events?

The complete expansion of the steam now occur across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occur in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduce the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced.

The stator consist of a similar, but fixed, series of blades serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhaust into a surface condenser provide a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"What the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant compared to that of an internal combustion engine?","id":"5711607f2419e314009555cd","answers":[{"text":"lower","answer_start":95},{"text":"lower","answer_start":95},{"text":"lower","answer_start":95},{"text":"lower","answer_start":95}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Along with internal combustion engines, what machines done superseded steam in some areas?","id":"5711607f2419e314009555ce","answers":[{"text":"electric motors","answer_start":232},{"text":"electric motors","answer_start":232},{"text":"internal combustion engines or electric motors","answer_start":201},{"text":"electric motors","answer_start":232}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What plants create most electric power?","id":"5711607f2419e314009555cf","answers":[{"text":"steam turbine","answer_start":297},{"text":"steam turbine","answer_start":297},{"text":"steam turbine plant","answer_start":297},{"text":"steam turbine plant","answer_start":297}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the name of the movement seek renewed use of steam power in the modern era?","id":"5711607f2419e314009555d0","answers":[{"text":"Advanced Steam","answer_start":576},{"text":"Advanced Steam movement","answer_start":576},{"text":"cogeneration processes","answer_start":501},{"text":"Advanced Steam movement","answer_start":576}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Along with fuel sources, what concern done contributed to the development of the Advanced Steam movement?","id":"5711607f2419e314009555d1","answers":[{"text":"pollution","answer_start":427},{"text":"pollution","answer_start":427},{"text":"Advanced Steam movement","answer_start":576},{"text":"pollution","answer_start":427}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"lower","answer_start":96}],"question":"What is the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant compared to that of a steam engine?","id":"5ad3c3bc604f3c001a3fef9f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"electric motors","answer_start":232}],"question":"Along with internal combustion engines, what machines have superseded power in some areas?","id":"5ad3c3bc604f3c001a3fefa0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"steam turbine","answer_start":297}],"question":"What plants create most combustion power?","id":"5ad3c3bc604f3c001a3fefa1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Advanced Steam","answer_start":581}],"question":"What is the name of the movement that seeks renewed use of combustion power in the modern era?","id":"5ad3c3bc604f3c001a3fefa2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"pollution","answer_start":432}],"question":"Along with fuel sources, what concern has contributed to the development of the combustion movement?","id":"5ad3c3bc604f3c001a3fefa3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The weight of boilers and condensers generally make the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines.

Lack of expansive working, or any means of control of the cutoff also a serious problem with many such designs.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"When Watt finish the development of his improvements to Newcomen engine?","id":"5711619950c2381900b54aaf","answers":[{"text":"1775","answer_start":66},{"text":"1763\u20131775","answer_start":61},{"text":"1775","answer_start":66},{"text":"1775","answer_start":66}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What Watt add to Newcomen engine between 1763 and 1775?","id":"5711619950c2381900b54ab0","answers":[{"text":"condenser","answer_start":128},{"text":"a separate condenser","answer_start":117},{"text":"condenser","answer_start":128},{"text":"a separate condenser","answer_start":117}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Compared to Smeaton improvement on Newcomen engine, how much coal did Watt engine use?","id":"5711619950c2381900b54ab1","answers":[{"text":"half","answer_start":175},{"text":"half as much","answer_start":175},{"text":"half as much coal","answer_start":175},{"text":"half","answer_start":175}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In addition to Watt, Boulton and Smeaton, whose engine was an atmosphere design?","id":"5711619950c2381900b54ab2","answers":[{"text":"Newcomen","answer_start":95},{"text":"Newcomen","answer_start":95},{"text":"Newcomen and Watt","answer_start":239},{"text":"Newcomen","answer_start":95}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In an atmospheric engine, what air pressure push against?","id":"5711619950c2381900b54ab3","answers":[{"text":"piston","answer_start":333},{"text":"a piston","answer_start":331},{"text":"piston","answer_start":333},{"text":"a piston","answer_start":331}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1775","answer_start":61}],"question":"When did Watt finish the development of his improvements to engine cylinders?","id":"5ad3c75a604f3c001a3ff045","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"condenser","answer_start":125}],"question":"What did Newcomen add to Wat's engine between 1763 and 1775?","id":"5ad3c75a604f3c001a3ff046","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"half","answer_start":174}],"question":"Compared to Smeaton's improvements on Newcomen's engine, how much steam did Watt's engine use?","id":"5ad3c75a604f3c001a3ff047","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Newcomen's","answer_start":242}],"question":"In addition to Watt, Boulton, and Smeaton, whose engine was a partial condenser design?","id":"5ad3c75a604f3c001a3ff048","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"piston","answer_start":342}],"question":"In a condenser engine, what does air pressure push against?","id":"5ad3c75a604f3c001a3ff049","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The next major step occurred when James Watt done developed (1763\u20131775) an improved version of Newcomen engine, with a separate condenser.

The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differ from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages."}]},"7":{"title":"Oxygen","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"The atomic number of the periodic table for oxygen?","id":"571a484210f8ca1400304fbd","answers":[{"text":"8","answer_start":58},{"text":"8","answer_start":58},{"text":"8","answer_start":58},{"text":"8","answer_start":58},{"text":"8","answer_start":58}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the second most abundant element?","id":"571a484210f8ca1400304fbe","answers":[{"text":"helium","answer_start":313},{"text":"helium","answer_start":313},{"text":"helium","answer_start":313},{"text":"helium","answer_start":313},{"text":"helium","answer_start":313}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which gas make up 20.8% of the Earth atmosphere?","id":"571a484210f8ca1400304fbf","answers":[{"text":"Diatomic oxygen","answer_start":467},{"text":"Diatomic oxygen","answer_start":467},{"text":"Diatomic oxygen gas","answer_start":467},{"text":"Diatomic oxygen","answer_start":467},{"text":"Diatomic oxygen gas","answer_start":467}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many atoms combine to form dioxygen?","id":"571a484210f8ca1400304fc0","answers":[{"text":"two atoms","answer_start":359},{"text":"two","answer_start":359},{"text":"two","answer_start":359},{"text":"two","answer_start":359},{"text":"two","answer_start":359}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Roughly, how much oxygen make up the Earth crust?","id":"571a484210f8ca1400304fc1","answers":[{"text":"almost half","answer_start":763},{"text":"almost half","answer_start":763},{"text":"half","answer_start":770},{"text":"almost half","answer_start":763},{"text":"half","answer_start":770}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the atomic number of the element oxygen?","id":"571c3a685efbb31900334db2","answers":[{"text":"8","answer_start":58},{"text":"8","answer_start":58},{"text":"8","answer_start":58},{"text":"8","answer_start":58},{"text":"8","answer_start":58}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Of what group in the periodic table oxygen a member?","id":"571c3a685efbb31900334db3","answers":[{"text":"chalcogen","answer_start":80},{"text":"chalcogen","answer_start":80},{"text":"chalcogen","answer_start":80},{"text":"chalcogen","answer_start":80},{"text":"the chalcogen group","answer_start":76}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of compounds do oxygen most commonly form?","id":"571c3a685efbb31900334db4","answers":[{"text":"oxides","answer_start":201},{"text":"oxides","answer_start":201},{"text":"oxides","answer_start":201},{"text":"oxide compounds","answer_start":712},{"text":"oxide","answer_start":201}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Compared to other elements, how abundant do oxygen rank?","id":"571c3a685efbb31900334db5","answers":[{"text":"third","answer_start":249},{"text":"third-most","answer_start":249},{"text":"third","answer_start":249},{"text":"third-most","answer_start":249},{"text":"third","answer_start":249}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Under normal conditions, what do two atoms of oxygen form?","id":"571c3a685efbb31900334db6","answers":[{"text":"dioxygen","answer_start":397},{"text":"diatomic gas","answer_start":432},{"text":"dioxygen","answer_start":397},{"text":"dioxygen","answer_start":397},{"text":"dioxygen","answer_start":397}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Oxygen","answer_start":0}],"question":"What element has an atomic symbol of O?","id":"5ad21646d7d075001a4283c4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Oxygen","answer_start":0}],"question":"What element has a symbol number of 8?","id":"5ad21646d7d075001a4283c5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"oxygen","answer_start":253}],"question":"What is the most abundant element in the universe followed by hydrogen and helium?","id":"5ad21646d7d075001a4283c6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Diatomic oxygen","answer_start":485}],"question":"What constitutes 28.0% of the Earth's atmosphere?","id":"5ad21646d7d075001a4283c7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Oxygen a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8.

Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration."},{"qas":[{"question":"______ In both liquid and gas form can fastly result in an exlposion.","id":"571a52cb4faf5e1900b8a969","answers":[{"text":"oxygen","answer_start":159},{"text":"oxygen","answer_start":159},{"text":"oxygen","answer_start":159}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"To ensure safety of future space missions Oxygen was used at _____ of the normal pressure.","id":"571a52cb4faf5e1900b8a96a","answers":[{"text":"1\u20443","answer_start":499},{"text":"1\u20443","answer_start":499},{"text":"1\u20443","answer_start":499},{"text":"1\u20443","answer_start":499},{"text":"1\u20443 normal pressure","answer_start":499}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"To reduce the chances of combustion ___ is required for safely handeling pure O.","id":"571a52cb4faf5e1900b8a96b","answers":[{"text":"special training","answer_start":249},{"text":"special training","answer_start":249},{"text":"special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized","answer_start":249},{"text":"special training","answer_start":249},{"text":"special training","answer_start":249}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What gon concentrated oxygen greatly speed up?","id":"571ce9bddd7acb1400e4c1a0","answers":[{"text":"combustion","answer_start":27},{"text":"combustion","answer_start":27},{"text":"combustion","answer_start":27},{"text":"combustion","answer_start":27},{"text":"combustion","answer_start":27}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Because of the danger inherent in concentrated oxygen, what a concern about keeping it?","id":"571ce9bddd7acb1400e4c1a1","answers":[{"text":"storage vessels","answer_start":92},{"text":"fire","answer_start":317},{"text":"ensure that ignition sources are minimized","answer_start":269},{"text":"special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized","answer_start":249}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the transport and storage demand for safety in dealing with oxygen?","id":"571ce9bddd7acb1400e4c1a2","answers":[{"text":"special training","answer_start":249},{"text":"special training","answer_start":249},{"text":"special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized","answer_start":249},{"text":"special training","answer_start":249},{"text":"special training","answer_start":249}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who a pressurized oxygen cabin fire kill?","id":"571ce9bddd7acb1400e4c1a4","answers":[{"text":"Apollo 1 crew","answer_start":333},{"text":"the Apollo 1 crew","answer_start":329},{"text":"the Apollo 1 crew","answer_start":329},{"text":"Apollo 1 crew","answer_start":333},{"text":"the Apollo 1 crew","answer_start":329}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"rapidly and energetically","answer_start":50}],"question":"How will steel pipes allow combustion to proceed?","id":"5ad2685dd7d075001a429276","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"pressurized","answer_start":418}],"question":"What type of fire killed the Apollo 1 crew?","id":"5ad2685dd7d075001a429278","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"proceed rapidly and energetically","answer_start":42}],"question":"What does concentrated O allow combustion to do?","id":"5ad2685dd7d075001a429279","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Concentrated O\n2 gon allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically.

Common uses of oxygen include the production cycle of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, in oxygen therapy and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving."},{"qas":[{"question":"What the term for the arrangement of two unpaired electrons in dioxygen?","id":"571c879bdd7acb1400e4c0ec","answers":[{"text":"spin triplet state","answer_start":343},{"text":"spin triplet state","answer_start":343},{"text":"spin triplet state","answer_start":343},{"text":"spin triplet state","answer_start":343},{"text":"a spin triplet state","answer_start":341}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How is the O2 molecule referred to in its ground state?","id":"571c879bdd7acb1400e4c0ed","answers":[{"text":"triplet oxygen","answer_start":425},{"text":"O","answer_start":394},{"text":"triplet oxygen","answer_start":425},{"text":"triplet oxygen","answer_start":425},{"text":"triplet oxygen","answer_start":425}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What cause triplet oxygen to react slowly?","id":"571c879bdd7acb1400e4c0ee","answers":[{"text":"unpaired electrons","answer_start":187},{"text":"its unpaired electrons","answer_start":580},{"text":"its unpaired electrons","answer_start":580},{"text":"Because of its unpaired electrons","answer_start":569},{"text":"unpaired electrons","answer_start":187}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of combustion do the slow reaction of triplet oxygen prevent?","id":"571c879bdd7acb1400e4c0ef","answers":[{"text":"spontaneous","answer_start":714},{"text":"spontaneous combustion","answer_start":714},{"text":"spontaneous","answer_start":714},{"text":"spontaneous","answer_start":714},{"text":"spontaneous combustion","answer_start":714}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the weakly filled higher orbitals of oxygen?","id":"571c879bdd7acb1400e4c0f0","answers":[{"text":"antibonding","answer_start":494},{"text":"antibonding","answer_start":494},{"text":"antibonding","answer_start":494},{"text":"antibonding","answer_start":494},{"text":"antibonding","answer_start":494}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"triplet oxygen","answer_start":435}],"question":"What is the ground state of the O molecule referred to as?","id":"5ad24369d7d075001a4289ea","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"combination of cancellations and \u03c3 and \u03c0 overlaps","answer_start":5}],"question":"What results in dioxygen's triplet bond character?","id":"5ad24369d7d075001a4289eb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"most organic molecules","answer_start":654}],"question":"What does double oxygen react slowly with?","id":"5ad24369d7d075001a4289ec","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"spontaneous combustion","answer_start":726}],"question":"What does double oxygen reacting slowly with most organic molecules prevent?","id":"5ad24369d7d075001a4289ed","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"This combination of cancellations and \u03c3 and \u03c0 overlaps results in dioxygen double bond character and reactivity, and a triplet electronic ground state.

Oxygen was liquified in stable state for the first time on March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University, Zygmunt Wr\u00f3blewski and Karol Olszewski."},{"qas":[{"question":"What celestial object eluded efforts to measure oxygen?","id":"571cac5d5efbb31900334dd0","answers":[{"text":"Sun","answer_start":211},{"text":"the Sun","answer_start":207},{"text":"the Sun","answer_start":207},{"text":"Sun","answer_start":211},{"text":"the Sun","answer_start":207}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What molecule the Sun have in higher proportion than Earth?","id":"571cac5d5efbb31900334dd1","answers":[{"text":"oxygen-16","answer_start":442},{"text":"oxygen-16","answer_start":442},{"text":"oxygen-16","answer_start":442},{"text":"oxygen-16","answer_start":442},{"text":"oxygen-16","answer_start":442}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What spacecraft contained data to determine the oxygen content of the Sun?","id":"571cac5d5efbb31900334dd2","answers":[{"text":"Genesis spacecraft","answer_start":372},{"text":"Genesis","answer_start":372},{"text":"Genesis","answer_start":372},{"text":"Genesis","answer_start":372},{"text":"Genesis","answer_start":372}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of process was involved the the depletion of the Sun oxygen 16?","id":"571cac5d5efbb31900334dd3","answers":[{"text":"unknown","answer_start":501},{"text":"an unknown process","answer_start":498},{"text":"unknown","answer_start":501},{"text":"unknown","answer_start":501},{"text":"an unknown process","answer_start":498}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Before the formation of which planet, Sol lose oxygen 16?","id":"571cac5d5efbb31900334dd4","answers":[{"text":"Earth","answer_start":95},{"text":"Earth","answer_start":95},{"text":"Earth","answer_start":95},{"text":"the Earth","answer_start":91},{"text":"Earth","answer_start":95}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites","answer_start":95}],"question":"Where have Genesis geologists measured oxygen isotopes?","id":"5ad25553d7d075001a428d34","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"in the Sun","answer_start":205}],"question":"Where were Genesis geologists unable to measure oxygen?","id":"5ad25553d7d075001a428d35","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space","answer_start":296}],"question":"What did the Planetary spacecraft analyze?","id":"5ad25553d7d075001a428d36","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the Sun","answer_start":407}],"question":"What does the Earth have a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than?","id":"5ad25553d7d075001a428d37","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Planetary geologists done measured different abundances of oxygen isotopes in samples from the Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites, but was long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the Sun, believed to be the same as those of the primordial solar nebula.

By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel  Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis was forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year.

This done meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts done had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice view is that if EU law conflict with a provision of national law, then EU law got primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could done brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if dey would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, done restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would \"ain't overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968.

In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wish to expressly legislate against EU law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary\" and so \"it have always been clear\" that UK courts got a duty \"to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.\" More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, dey could be \"fundamental principles\" of common law, and Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation\" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU do not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, \"so long as\" the EU work towards the democratisation of its institutions, and got a framework protect fundamental human rights, it would not review EU no legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles.

A member state could \"not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entail.\" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it done not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm no systems, on no basis that it done not been notified to the Commission as no Directive required.

The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

But, fifth, if a member state done failed to implement a Directive, a citizen may ain't able to bring claims against other non-state parties, but can sue the member state itself for failure to implement the law. So, in Francovich v Italy, the Italian government done failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers done gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss.

Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. This was the first time competition law principles was included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules was included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market ain't distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies was established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid.

According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them got a less productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages was considerably mixed, and it remain unclear whether the \"endgame\" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but gon burden people lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so-called \"four freedoms\" was thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e.g. different Value Added Tax rates). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade ain't supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice done taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people well being."},{"qas":[{"question":"What help the process of free movement of goods?","id":"5726b718dd62a815002e8dbe","answers":[{"text":"a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination","answer_start":64},{"text":"a customs union","answer_start":64},{"text":"a customs union","answer_start":64}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What article 34 discriminate against in Procureur du Roi v Dassonville?","id":"5726b718dd62a815002e8dbf","answers":[{"text":"parallel importers like Mr Dassonville","answer_start":833},{"text":"parallel importers","answer_start":833},{"text":"parallel importers","answer_start":833}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Article 34 meant states could be responsible for what?","id":"5726b718dd62a815002e8dc0","answers":[{"text":"private actors","answer_start":1214},{"text":"private actors","answer_start":1214},{"text":"private actors","answer_start":1214}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which case was French vigilantes sabotaging shipments of Spanish Strawberries?","id":"5726b718dd62a815002e8dc1","answers":[{"text":"Commission v France","answer_start":1247},{"text":"Commission v France French","answer_start":1247},{"text":"Commission v France French","answer_start":1247}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In Schmidberger v Austria, the Court of Justice came to the conclusion that Austria ain't infringe upon no article 34 by failing to ban a what?","id":"5726b718dd62a815002e8dc2","answers":[{"text":"a protest blocked heavy traffic","answer_start":2349},{"text":"a protest","answer_start":2349},{"text":"a protest","answer_start":2349}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination","answer_start":64}],"question":"What does not help the free movement of goods?","id":"5ad15289645df0001a2d175a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"duties","answer_start":169}],"question":"What is not prohibited between member states?","id":"5ad15289645df0001a2d175b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"imports","answer_start":137}],"question":"What the the EU not manage from non-member states?","id":"5ad15289645df0001a2d175c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"private actors","answer_start":1229}],"question":"What were states not responsible for in Article 34?","id":"5ad15289645df0001a2d175d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Commission v France","answer_start":1262}],"question":"What case were French vigilantes helping shipments of Spanish Strawberries?","id":"5ad15289645df0001a2d175e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manage imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, could not get no certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, apply equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company had government appointees. It also mean states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes was continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state got laws or practices directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it done been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe no article 34 by failing to ban a protest blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger German undertaking, was prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018fundamental pillars of a democratic society\u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it take gotta be applied proportionately. This mean the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36."},{"qas":[{"question":"What the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law require all spirits and liqueur to have?","id":"5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e8","answers":[{"text":"25","answer_start":708},{"text":"25 per cent","answer_start":708},{"text":"25 per cent","answer_start":708}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which country Rewe-Zentrale AG wish to import from?","id":"5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e9","answers":[{"text":"France","answer_start":918},{"text":"France","answer_start":918},{"text":"France","answer_start":918}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which year was the case Commission v Italy dealt with cocoa products?","id":"5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ea","answers":[{"text":"2003","answer_start":1775},{"text":"2003","answer_start":1775},{"text":"2003","answer_start":1775}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?","id":"5726b929f1498d1400e8e8eb","answers":[{"text":"cocoa butter","answer_start":1990},{"text":"cocoa butter","answer_start":1990},{"text":"cocoa butter","answer_start":1990}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?","id":"5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ec","answers":[{"text":"motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers","answer_start":2551},{"text":"motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers","answer_start":2551},{"text":"motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers","answer_start":2551}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"25 per cent","answer_start":710}],"question":"What was maximum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?","id":"5ad153e9645df0001a2d1796","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"France","answer_start":921}],"question":"Which country dod Rewe-Zentrale AG not wish to import from?","id":"5ad153e9645df0001a2d1797","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Court of Justice","answer_start":965}],"question":"Who accepted the German government's arguments that the measure proportional protected public health?","id":"5ad153e9645df0001a2d1798","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label","answer_start":2203}],"question":"What did the Court of Justice justify about a low content of vegetable fat?","id":"5ad153e9645df0001a2d1799","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measure the Court of Justice done developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories ain't closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs was over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages was available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily apply to requirements about a product content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"no chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify \"chocolate substitute\" no label. This was derogatory in the consumers eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make no trailers. This ain't product no requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affect the access of that product to the market\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which two importers claimed that under a French competition law, they was prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?","id":"5726ba2c708984140094cf59","answers":[{"text":"Keck and Mithouard","answer_start":289},{"text":"Keck and Mithouard","answer_start":289},{"text":"Keck and Mithouard","answer_start":289}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The aim of the French competition law was to do what?","id":"5726ba2c708984140094cf5a","answers":[{"text":"cut throat competition","answer_start":496},{"text":"prevent cut throat competition","answer_start":488},{"text":"prevent cut throat competition","answer_start":488}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which case the Court of Justice review Swedish bans on advertising to young children under 12?","id":"5726ba2c708984140094cf5b","answers":[{"text":"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini","answer_start":978},{"text":"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini","answer_start":978},{"text":"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini","answer_start":978}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Under which Directive the EU harmonize restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising?","id":"5726ba2c708984140094cf5c","answers":[{"text":"the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive","answer_start":1852},{"text":"the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive","answer_start":1852},{"text":"the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive","answer_start":1852}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Keck and Mithouard","answer_start":291}],"question":"Which two importers did not claim that under French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?","id":"5ad1556e645df0001a2d17da","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"selling arrangements","answer_start":128}],"question":"What did the Court of Justice rule fell under TFEU article 34?","id":"5ad1556e645df0001a2d17db","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade","answer_start":487}],"question":"What was not the aim of the TFEU article 34 law?","id":"5ad1556e645df0001a2d17dc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini","answer_start":990}],"question":"Which case did the Court of Justice not review Swedish bans on advertising to young children und er 12?","id":"5ad1556e645df0001a2d17dd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In contrast to product requirements or other laws hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that \"selling arrangements\" would be presumed to not fall into TFEU no article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder no trade. The Court of Justice held, as \"in law and in fact\" it was an equally applicable \"selling arrangement\" (not something alter a product content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not gotta be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \"in fact\" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but dey is restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans done remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising was \"the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate\" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers \"traditional social practices and to local habits and customs\" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \"factor of production\". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This mean the basic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" anybody economically active, which include everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in no money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as dey was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. \"worker\" status mean protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), got rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement done become politically contentious as nationalist political parties done manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically \"all available research find little impact\" of \"labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers\"."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which articles of the Free Movement of Workers Regulation set out the primary provisions on equal treatment of workers?","id":"5726bc1add62a815002e8ea6","answers":[{"text":"article 1 to 7","answer_start":40},{"text":"article 1 to 7","answer_start":40},{"text":"article 1 to 7","answer_start":40}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which Belgian footballer claimed that he should be allowed to transfer from one football club to another when his contract was fulfilled?","id":"5726bc1add62a815002e8ea7","answers":[{"text":"Jean-Marc Bosman","answer_start":376},{"text":"the Belgian Football Association v Bosman","answer_start":306},{"text":"Jean-Marc Bosman","answer_start":376}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What language the Court of Justice accept to be required to teach in a Dublin college in Groner v Minister for Education?","id":"5726bc1add62a815002e8ea8","answers":[{"text":"Gaelic","answer_start":866},{"text":"Gaelic","answer_start":866},{"text":"Gaelic","answer_start":866}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which case was a Dutch national not entitled to continue receiving benefits when he moved to Belgium?","id":"5726bc1add62a815002e8ea9","answers":[{"text":"Hendrix v Employee","answer_start":2516},{"text":"Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute","answer_start":2516},{"text":"Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute","answer_start":2516}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In the case Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, how many hours was the Dutch woman in question working in Germany?","id":"5726bc1add62a815002e8eaa","answers":[{"text":"between 3 and 14 hours a week","answer_start":2913},{"text":"3 and 14 hours a week","answer_start":2921},{"text":"between 3 and 14 hours a week","answer_start":2913}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7","answer_start":0}],"question":"What did not set out the main provision on equal treatment of workers?","id":"5ad157cf645df0001a2d1814","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state","answer_start":169}],"question":"What did articles 1 to 4 not generally require of workers?","id":"5ad157cf645df0001a2d1815","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Jean-Marc Bosman","answer_start":374}],"question":"Which Belgian footballer claimed that he should not be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Liege to USL Dunkerque?","id":"5ad157cf645df0001a2d1816","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"equal treatment","answer_start":2411}],"question":"What did most people not require regarding social advantages?","id":"5ad157cf645df0001a2d1817","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service","answer_start":3197}],"question":"What is the general justificatin for not limiting free movement in TFEUrticles 45(3)?","id":"5ad157cf645df0001a2d1818","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The Free Movement of Workers Regulation article 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer no discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rule constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and was unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure ain't disproportionate. By no contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) require equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man wrought in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court done approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have no right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man  done wrought full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice done held that secondary education fall outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state fund it, though higher education do not. Health care generally count as a service. In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within no article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \"service\" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \"international medical science\" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court require that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this also true in the context of the UK National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs was controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \"undesirable developments in securities trading\" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \"laserdrome\" business was banned by the Bonn council.

This meant the Daily Mail newspaper parent company could not evade no tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not gotta justify its action, as rules on company seats was not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a31 of capital to start a company, while Denmark legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around \u20ac27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and dey was less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attract most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company no right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wish to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draw a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it ain't entirely clear why."}]},"10":{"title":"Amazon_rainforest","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Which name is also used to describe the Amazon rainforest

are reasonably well supported by the available data."},{"qas":[{"question":"What the name of the satellite measured the amount of

She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52\/sq mi) is the maximum can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population.

The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis tentilla got three types of movement are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle."},{"qas":[{"question":"How many rows of combs there?","id":"572659ea5951b619008f7051","answers":[{"text":"eight rows","answer_start":7},{"text":"eight","answer_start":7},{"text":"eight","answer_start":7}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where the rows of combs located?","id":"572659ea5951b619008f7052","answers":[{"text":"from near the mouth to the opposite end","answer_start":31},{"text":"near the mouth to the opposite end","answer_start":36},{"text":"near the mouth to the opposite end","answer_start":36}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How are the combs spaced?","id":"572659ea5951b619008f7053","answers":[{"text":"evenly round the body","answer_start":87},{"text":"evenly","answer_start":87},{"text":"evenly round the body","answer_start":87}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What run from the balancer in the statocyst to the comb row","id":"572659ea5951b619008f7054","answers":[{"text":"ciliary groove","answer_start":225},{"text":"a ciliary groove","answer_start":223},{"text":"a ciliary groove","answer_start":223}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"eight","answer_start":10}],"question":"How many rows of statocysts are there?","id":"5a838553e60761001a2eb759","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"metachronal rhythm","answer_start":140}],"question":"What kind of rhythm do the statocysts have?","id":"5a838553e60761001a2eb75a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"evenly round the body","answer_start":95}],"question":"How are the statocysts spaced?","id":"5a838553e60761001a2eb75b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"rows","answer_start":16}],"question":"What are the statocysts alligned in when being evenly spaced?","id":"5a838553e60761001a2eb75c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"two adjacent comb rows","answer_start":304}],"question":"What does the statocyst split to connect with?","id":"5a838553e60761001a2eb75d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Dey is eight rows of combs run from near the mouth to the opposite end, and are spaced evenly round the body.

However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels."},{"qas":[{"question":"Why ctenophores extremely rare as fossils?","id":"57268da7f1498d1400e8e39c","answers":[{"text":"Because of their soft, gelatinous bodies","answer_start":0},{"text":"their soft, gelatinous bodies","answer_start":11},{"text":"their soft, gelatinous bodies","answer_start":11}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Ediacaran eoandromeda can be regarded to represent what?","id":"57268da7f1498d1400e8e39d","answers":[{"text":"comb jelly.","answer_start":1192},{"text":"comb jelly","answer_start":1192},{"text":"a comb jelly","answer_start":1190}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the period called  done was 505 million years ago?","id":"57268da7f1498d1400e8e39e","answers":[{"text":"Cambrian period.","answer_start":553},{"text":"mid-Cambrian period","answer_start":549},{"text":"mid-Cambrian period","answer_start":549}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many species was found in the Burgess Shale?","id":"57268da7f1498d1400e8e39f","answers":[{"text":"Three additional putative species","answer_start":403},{"text":"Three","answer_start":403},{"text":"Three","answer_start":403}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the  fossils found in the Burgess Shale lack?","id":"57268da7f1498d1400e8e3a0","answers":[{"text":"lacked tentacles","answer_start":591},{"text":"tentacles","answer_start":598},{"text":"tentacles","answer_start":598}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"early Devonian (Emsian) period","answer_start":381}],"question":"When did the first tentacles form on ctenophores?","id":"5a839ccfe60761001a2eb81f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Three","answer_start":413}],"question":"How many prominent tentacles were found 1996?","id":"5a839ccfe60761001a2eb820","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"about 505 million years ago","answer_start":525}],"question":"How long ago was the Ediacaran period?","id":"5a839ccfe60761001a2eb821","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"internal organ-like structures","answer_start":732}],"question":"What kind of structures are typical in living lagerstatten?","id":"5a839ccfe60761001a2eb822","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1996","answer_start":852}],"question":"In what year was the Edicaran Eoandromeda named?","id":"5a839ccfe60761001a2eb823","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Because of their soft, gelatinous bodies, ctenophores extremely rare as fossils, and fossils done been interpreted as ctenophores done been found only in lagerst\u00e4tten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue.

A series of studies looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes done also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types was either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers done argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead.

Instead he found that various cydippid families was more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids ain't monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species was very small \u2013 so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggest that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished.

But X.25 do it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay do it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 require a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay do not define any such handshakes. X.25 do not define no operations inside the packet network. It only operate at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider free to use any procedure it wish inside the network. X.25 specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provide conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay a modified version of ISDN layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-no end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consist of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operate principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rid itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still got the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay make it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it do not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers gotta be correlated to network addresses. The same true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC\/LAPD\/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay done been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995>"},{"qas":[{"question":"WHen ARPNET and SITA become operational","id":"57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7b","answers":[{"text":"1969","answer_start":43},{"text":"1969","answer_start":43},{"text":"1969","answer_start":43}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"2 differences betwen X.25 and ARPNET CITA technologies","id":"57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7c","answers":[{"text":"Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core","answer_start":155},{"text":"the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core.","answer_start":192},{"text":"division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core","answer_start":196}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"WHat do UserDatagram Protocol gaurentee","id":"57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7d","answers":[{"text":"In the virtual call system, the network guarantee sequenced delivery of data to the host","answer_start":459},{"text":"sequenced delivery of data to the host","answer_start":509},{"text":"sequenced delivery of data","answer_start":509}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"X.25 use what type network type","id":"57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7e","answers":[{"text":"User Datagram Protocol","answer_start":395},{"text":"the datagram model","answer_start":621},{"text":"UDP","answer_start":419}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"about twenty","answer_start":90}],"question":"How many different network technologies where there before 1973?","id":"5a550f98134fea001a0e189c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The User Datagram Protocol","answer_start":391}],"question":"What type of network does SITA HLN not use?","id":"5a550f98134fea001a0e189d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"host interface","answer_start":579}],"question":"X.25 had a simpler what?","id":"5a550f98134fea001a0e189e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the datagram model","answer_start":626}],"question":"X.25 had less functionality because of what?","id":"5a550f98134fea001a0e189f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core","answer_start":235}],"question":"What defined the differences between the ARPANET and SITA HLN and X.25?","id":"5a550f98134fea001a0e18a0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"about twenty different network technologies had been developed","answer_start":90}],"question":"After the introduction of X.25 in 1973, how many network technologies had been developed?","id":"5a6688fcf038b7001ab0bf6c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host","answer_start":490}],"question":"In UDP, the network guarantees what?","id":"5a6688fcf038b7001ab0bf6d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The X.25 protocol suite uses this network type.","answer_start":646}],"question":"What suite uses UDP?","id":"5a6688fcf038b7001ab0bf6e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets.","answer_start":318}],"question":"In a virtual call system, the hosts have what responsibility?","id":"5a6688fcf038b7001ab0bf6f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969.

With initial support from the State of Michigan and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in December 1971 when an interactive host to host connection was made between the IBM mainframe computer systems at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne State University in Detroit. In October 1972 connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan State University in East Lansing completed the triad. Over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections, host to host batch connections (remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer), interactive file transfer, gateways to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks, X.25 host attachments, gateways to X.25 data networks, Ethernet attached hosts, and eventually TCP\/IP and additional public universities in Michigan join the network.

The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts done become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage result in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host.

However, no single alternative solution done achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague attack the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.

Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes was explained as convergent boundaries, where one plate subduct under another. Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas fault system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener theory of continental drift, in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time.

Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in no volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults ain't planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occur along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting.

Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi (Rhazes) (865\u2013915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provide the reader with recipes and explain how to prepare the `simples\u2019 from which was compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact was also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008\u20131074), both of which was printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describe the distillation of sea-water for drinking.[verification needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"How far one pharmacy in Croatia date back to?","id":"5726deed5951b619008f80c5","answers":[{"text":"1317","answer_start":122},{"text":"1317","answer_start":122},{"text":"1317","answer_start":122}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where the oldest pharmacy stated to be located?","id":"5726deed5951b619008f80c6","answers":[{"text":"Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy","answer_start":261},{"text":"Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy","answer_start":261},{"text":"Florence, Italy","answer_start":294}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the medieval Esteve Pharmacy used as at present?","id":"5726deed5951b619008f80c7","answers":[{"text":"museum","answer_start":337},{"text":"a museum","answer_start":441},{"text":"museum","answer_start":337}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What sorts of items are displayed in the Esteve Pharmacy museum?","id":"5726deed5951b619008f80c8","answers":[{"text":"albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries, old prescription books and antique drugs","answer_start":490},{"text":"albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries, old prescription books and antique drugs","answer_start":490},{"text":"old prescription books and antique drugs","answer_start":535}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In what year is the oldest pharmacy said to done been established?","id":"5726deed5951b619008f80c9","answers":[{"text":"1221","answer_start":249},{"text":"1221","answer_start":249},{"text":"1221","answer_start":249}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy","answer_start":264}],"question":"Where is the newest pharmacy stated to be located?","id":"5a6cdddf4eec6b001a80a65c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1221","answer_start":252}],"question":"What year is the oldest pharmacy said to have been lost?","id":"5a6cdddf4eec6b001a80a65d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"museum","answer_start":447}],"question":"What is the medieval Esteve Pharmacy no longer used as at present?","id":"5a6cdddf4eec6b001a80a65e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries, old prescription books and antique drugs","answer_start":495}],"question":"What sorts of items are never displayed in the Esteve Pharmacy museum?","id":"5a6cdddf4eec6b001a80a65f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In Europe dey is old pharmacies still operating in Dubrovnik, Croatia, located inside the Franciscan monastery, opened in 1317; and in the Town Hall Square of Tallinn, Estonia, dating from at least 1422.

This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, whose works was part of the Harvard curriculum at the time.

In fact, it differ from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap.

When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimate that trade liberalisation done had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attribute this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concede that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data international trade is increasing income inequality.

In humans, the blood\u2013brain barrier, blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid\u2013brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protect the brain."},{"qas":[{"question":"What happen when the immune system less active than normal?","id":"5728f2e26aef051400154896","answers":[{"text":"Immunodeficiency","answer_start":100},{"text":"Immunodeficiency","answer_start":100},{"text":"Immunodeficiency occur","answer_start":100}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the term for a hyperactive immune system attack normal tissues?","id":"5728f2e26aef051400154897","answers":[{"text":"autoimmunity","answer_start":438},{"text":"autoimmunity","answer_start":438},{"text":"autoimmunity","answer_start":438}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What field involve the study of the immune system?","id":"5728f2e26aef051400154898","answers":[{"text":"Immunology","answer_start":691},{"text":"Immunology","answer_start":691},{"text":"Immunology","answer_start":691}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What acquired condition results in immunodeficiency in humans?","id":"5728f2e26aef051400154899","answers":[{"text":"HIV\/AIDS","answer_start":371},{"text":"HIV\/AIDS","answer_start":371},{"text":"HIV\/AIDS","answer_start":371}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"cancer","answer_start":92}],"question":"What is not caused by disorders of the immune system?","id":"5ad49faaba00c4001a268e24","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"immunosuppressive","answer_start":399}],"question":"What kind of medicine can cause autoimmunity?","id":"5ad49faaba00c4001a268e25","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"autoimmunity","answer_start":442}],"question":"What causes the immune system to treat foreign organisms like normal tissues?","id":"5ad49faaba00c4001a268e26","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"HIV\/AIDS","answer_start":375}],"question":"What is not a condition that causes immunodeficiency?","id":"5ad49faaba00c4001a268e27","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Hashimoto's thyroiditis","answer_start":591}],"question":"What is a rare autoimmune disease?","id":"5ad49faaba00c4001a268e28","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer.

Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which trigger degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type II hypersensitivity occur when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop.

A publicly accessible database done been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells.

These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like na\u00efve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response). In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1\/Th2 cytokine balance towards one supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and na\u00efve T cell migration to lymph nodes.

A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires was built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"done come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions the core and the periphery. The core consist of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics done led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stress how important new political world order done become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focus on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations."},{"qas":[{"question":"Imperialism is confused with what other term?","id":"573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6d","answers":[{"text":"colonialism","answer_start":48},{"text":"colonialism","answer_start":48},{"text":"colonialism","answer_start":48},{"text":"colonialism","answer_start":48},{"text":"colonialism","answer_start":48}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What colonialism lack that imperialism have","id":"573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6e","answers":[{"text":"political focus","answer_start":1212},{"text":"political focus","answer_start":1212},{"text":"political focus","answer_start":1212},{"text":"political focus","answer_start":1212},{"text":"ideological","answer_start":387}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Colonialism as a policy is caused by financial and what other reasons?","id":"573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6f","answers":[{"text":"ideological","answer_start":387},{"text":"ideological","answer_start":387},{"text":"ideological","answer_start":387},{"text":"commercial","answer_start":485}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who besides the Russians are often left out of the colonialism debat?","id":"573083dc2461fd1900a9ce70","answers":[{"text":"Ottoman","answer_start":994},{"text":"Ottoman","answer_start":994},{"text":"Ottoman","answer_start":994},{"text":"Ottoman","answer_start":994},{"text":"Ottoman","answer_start":994}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Imperialism and colonialism both assert a states dominance over what?","id":"573083dc2461fd1900a9ce71","answers":[{"text":"person or group of people","answer_start":254},{"text":"a person or group of people","answer_start":252},{"text":"a person or group of people","answer_start":252},{"text":"person or group of people","answer_start":254}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"colonialism","answer_start":48}],"question":"Imperialism is synonymous with what other term?","id":"5acff5b077cf76001a686628","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"political focus","answer_start":1222}],"question":" What does colonialism and imperialism share?","id":"5acff5b077cf76001a686629","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"ideological","answer_start":392}],"question":"Colonialism as a policy is never caused by financial and what other reasons?","id":"5acff5b077cf76001a68662a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Ottoman","answer_start":1003}],"question":"Who besides the Russians are often included in the colonialism debat?","id":"5acff5b077cf76001a68662b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"person or group of people","answer_start":257}],"question":"Imperialism and colonialism don't assert a states dominance over what?","id":"5acff5b077cf76001a68662c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The term \"imperialism\" is often conflated with \"colonialism\", however many scholars done argued that each got their own distinct definition.

Colonialism in modern usage also tend to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguish the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; \"imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refer to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.'

Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begin a conquest over an area and then eventually able to rule over the areas the previous nation done controlled. Colonialism core meaning the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war.

Rather, by essentializing the East, this discourse use the idea of place-based identities to create difference and distance between \"we\" the West and \"them\" the East, or \"here\" in the West and \"there\" in the East. This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West. Defining the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the West sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled.

The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left done followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers done expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designate neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term done expanded, its meaning done shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal.

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries gon come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It done also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union done itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fa\u00e7ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism was widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism."},{"qas":[{"question":"What was the first British empire based on?","id":"5730b541396df919000962c2","answers":[{"text":"mercantilism","answer_start":38},{"text":"mercantilism","answer_start":38},{"text":"mercantilism","answer_start":38},{"text":"mercantilism","answer_start":38},{"text":"mercantilism","answer_start":38}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When Great Britain lose its colonies in North America?","id":"5730b541396df919000962c3","answers":[{"text":"1776","answer_start":205},{"text":"1776","answer_start":205},{"text":"1776","answer_start":205},{"text":"1776","answer_start":205},{"text":"1776","answer_start":205}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When the Spanish and Portuguese colonies gain their independance.","id":"5730b541396df919000962c4","answers":[{"text":"about 1820","answer_start":424},{"text":"1820","answer_start":430},{"text":"1820","answer_start":430},{"text":"1820","answer_start":430},{"text":"1820","answer_start":430}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What policy gave Britain dominance in world trade?","id":"5730b541396df919000962c5","answers":[{"text":"free trade","answer_start":501},{"text":"free trade","answer_start":501},{"text":"free trade","answer_start":501},{"text":"free trade","answer_start":501},{"text":"free trade","answer_start":501}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was the defeat of Napoleonic France?","id":"5730b541396df919000962c6","answers":[{"text":"1815","answer_start":731},{"text":"1815","answer_start":731},{"text":"1815","answer_start":731},{"text":"1815","answer_start":731},{"text":"1815","answer_start":731}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"mercantilism","answer_start":38}],"question":"What wasn't the first British empire based on?","id":"5ad03a1a77cf76001a686e6c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1776","answer_start":205}],"question":" When did Great Britain gain its colonies in North America?","id":"5ad03a1a77cf76001a686e6d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1820","answer_start":430}],"question":" When did the Spanish and Portuguese colonies lose their independance.","id":"5ad03a1a77cf76001a686e6e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"free trade","answer_start":500}],"question":" What policy took away Britain dominance in world trade?","id":"5ad03a1a77cf76001a686e6f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The First British Empire was based on mercantilism, and involved colonies and holdings primarily in North America, the Caribbean, and India.

The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of Fran\u00e7ois Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and was believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. While many parties to the conflict blamed others (the Indians blamed the French for bringing \"bad medicine\" as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry), the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle. Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg, while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics done worked quite effectively in previous years."},{"qas":[{"question":"What led to Newcastle fall from power as military advisor?","id":"5734025d4776f419006616c3","answers":[{"text":"British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the European theater","answer_start":4},{"text":"British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the European theater","answer_start":4},{"text":"British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the Europe","answer_start":4},{"text":"failures in North America","answer_start":12},{"text":"British failures in North America","answer_start":4}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who Abercrombie replace as commander in chief?","id":"5734025d4776f419006616c4","answers":[{"text":"Loudoun","answer_start":358},{"text":"Duke of Cumberland","answer_start":173},{"text":"Loudoun","answer_start":358},{"text":"Pitt","answer_start":207},{"text":"Newcastle","answer_start":123}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Pitt plan called for what attacks?","id":"5734025d4776f419006616c5","answers":[{"text":"three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops","answer_start":475},{"text":"three major offensive actions","answer_start":475},{"text":"three major offensive actions","answer_start":475},{"text":"three major offensive actions","answer_start":475},{"text":"three major offensive actions","answer_start":475}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many of the Pitt planned expeditions was successful?","id":"5734025d4776f419006616c6","answers":[{"text":"Two of the expeditions was successful, with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg","answer_start":635},{"text":"Two","answer_start":635},{"text":"Two","answer_start":635},{"text":"Two","answer_start":635},{"text":"Two","answer_start":635}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the European theater","answer_start":4}],"question":"What led to Newcastle's rise to power as military advisor?","id":"5ad3b9cd604f3c001a3fee87","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the European theater","answer_start":4}],"question":"What led to Newcastle's fall from power as political advisor?","id":"5ad3b9cd604f3c001a3fee88","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Loudoun","answer_start":363}],"question":"Who didn't Abercrombie replace as commander in chief?","id":"5ad3b9cd604f3c001a3fee89","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Loudoun","answer_start":363}],"question":"Who did Abercrombie replace as captain in chief?","id":"5ad3b9cd604f3c001a3fee8a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Two of the expeditions were successful","answer_start":641}],"question":"How many of the Pitt's planned expeditions weren't successful?","id":"5ad3b9cd604f3c001a3fee8b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the European theater, led to the fall from power of Newcastle and his principal military advisor, the Duke of Cumberland.

He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer move the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause act on it.

This because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other got no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors gon make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector is in the same direction as one of the forces desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two."},{"qas":[{"question":"What can keep an object from moving when it is being pushed on a surface?","id":"57376df3c3c5551400e51ed7","answers":[{"text":"static friction","answer_start":145},{"text":"static friction","answer_start":145},{"text":"friction","answer_start":31},{"text":"static friction","answer_start":145},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":117}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is generated between a surface and an object is being pushed?","id":"57376df3c3c5551400e51ed8","answers":[{"text":"static friction","answer_start":145},{"text":"static friction","answer_start":145},{"text":"static friction","answer_start":145},{"text":"static friction","answer_start":145},{"text":"static friction","answer_start":145}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Static friction balance what force when dey is no movement of an object on a surface?","id":"57376df3c3c5551400e51ed9","answers":[{"text":"applied","answer_start":117},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":117},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":117},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":117},{"text":"applied","answer_start":117}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What make static friction go up or down in responce to contact characteristics between an object and the surface it is on?","id":"57376df3c3c5551400e51eda","answers":[{"text":"applied force","answer_start":117},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":117},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":117},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":117},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":117}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a situation where the object does not move","answer_start":64}],"question":"Pulling on an object on a frictional surface can result in what?","id":"5ad26a5fd7d075001a429318","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Pushing against an object on a frictional surface","answer_start":0}],"question":"When will an object move because the applied force is opposed by static friction?","id":"5ad26a5fd7d075001a429319","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"static friction","answer_start":345}],"question":"What increases or decreases in response to applied friction?","id":"5ad26a5fd7d075001a42931a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"static friction","answer_start":345}],"question":"What increases or decreases in response to static friction?","id":"5ad26a5fd7d075001a42931b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object do not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface.

Galileo realized that simple velocity addition demand that the concept of an \"absolute rest frame\" did not exist. Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest. This was contrary to Aristotle notion of a \"natural state\" of rest object with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest was correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship.

This yield both the tangential force, which accelerate the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which change its direction."},{"qas":[{"question":"What the only form potential energy can change into?","id":"5737a7351c456719005744f1","answers":[{"text":"kinetic","answer_start":115},{"text":"kinetic","answer_start":115},{"text":"kinetic","answer_start":115},{"text":"kinetic","answer_start":115}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the only form kinetic energy can change into?","id":"5737a7351c456719005744f2","answers":[{"text":"potential","answer_start":126},{"text":"potential","answer_start":126},{"text":"potential","answer_start":126},{"text":"potential","answer_start":126}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is preserved in a closed system of forces when acted upon?","id":"5737a7351c456719005744f3","answers":[{"text":"net mechanical energy","answer_start":183},{"text":"net mechanical energy","answer_start":183},{"text":"net mechanical energy","answer_start":183},{"text":"net mechanical energy","answer_start":183}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the force between two locations related to?","id":"5737a7351c456719005744f4","answers":[{"text":"difference in potential energy","answer_start":316},{"text":"the difference in potential energy","answer_start":312},{"text":"the difference in potential energy","answer_start":312},{"text":"the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space","answer_start":312}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What the force called rgarding a potential field between two locations?","id":"5737a7351c456719005744f5","answers":[{"text":"artifact","answer_start":420},{"text":"artifact of the potential field","answer_start":420},{"text":"an artifact","answer_start":417}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"associated","answer_start":57}],"question":"A liberal force that acts on a closed system has what kind of mechanical work?","id":"5ad2895bd7d075001a429982","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"conserved","answer_start":221}],"question":"Net mechanical energy is what in an open system?","id":"5ad2895bd7d075001a429983","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"force","answer_start":285}],"question":"What can not be considered an artifact of the potential field?","id":"5ad2895bd7d075001a429984","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the contour map of the elevation of an area","answer_start":570}],"question":"A flow of water can not be considered an artifact of what?","id":"5ad2895bd7d075001a429985","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"A conservative force act on a closed system got an associated mechanical work allow energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms.
